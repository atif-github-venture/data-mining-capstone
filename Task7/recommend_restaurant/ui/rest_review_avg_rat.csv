Maharani Restaurant,i crave indian food pretty regularly and im happy to know that there are a number of indian restaurants in madison to satisfy my cravingthe samosa vegetable pakora paneer (cheese) pakora are decent  however the aloo tikki (small spicy potato discs) is very tasty with the right amount of spicesi love parantha (layered whole wheat bread made with melted butter) and the maharani parantha here are delicious and remind me of when i used to make these with mom  you have to eat them right when they come out though because thats when theyre the best - hot buttery crispy and tender  the roti naan is pretty good too  made exactly the way naan is (baked in a tandoor oven) except they use whole wheat flour instead of white flour  the chicken tikka masala is delectable  the sauce is orange colored rich creamy and has nice chunks of boneless chicken (could use more chunks of chicken)  this is also spiced really nicely  you get a choice of mild medium or hot for the level of spiciness in your dishes  medium here is really good - it teeters on medium and hotthe palak paneer (spinach cooked with homemade cheese) is earthy spicy and buttery  this is really really good  the only thing about the dish is that the ginger pieces were a little overwhelmingdessertgulab jamun (its like a deep fried dounut hole soaked in sugar syrup) has been my favorite indian dessert since childhood  not a lot of places know how to make this dessert right  it has to be lite and airy not dense and hard  maharani makes it just right and hot off of the stove!  its delicious! this is the best indian restaurant ive ever been to!  ive tried quite a few of their many vegetarian items but always come back to the palak paneer and veggie pakora to start  im typically not a fan of buffets but maharani keeps it very fresh  the servers have always been very friendly to me and i love the fact that the dining room is so quiet  also there is actually a difference between mild spice medium spicy and hot spicy which hasnt always been my experience at other restaurants ah maharani you might be my new comfort food  indian food has never really been my thing but am guessing ive either ordered wrong or been to some pretty bad indian restaurants  went for the first time last week with a group of four people one of whom dines there fairly frequently  very attentive unobtrusive service  ive been craving the butter chicken & palak paneer (spinach cooked with homemade cheese) scooped up with the garlic naan every day since my visit  so much so that i need to end my review and go get some carry out,4.333333333333333,3
The Dhaba,as i am writing this for whatever reason the punjab pimp daler mehndi is thumping in my head  tunook tunook mmm da da da i first want to mention the extreme politeness i get whenever i call to place a take out order they unlike other indian cuisine restaurants want my businessyours too; and it shows the menu is very broad which i love they have full vegan entrees although i am not close to being vegan i do love alot of vegetable dishes and dhaba has many the vegetable meatballs are outstanding i have never had a bad meal hear although some of my favorite go-to foods i can find better eleswhere so everytime i do eat here i get something new my go to items by the way are mushroom matar palak paneer and a protein ie lamb goat or chicken the dishes here always are fresh fragrant plentiful bright and overall spiced very nice i prefer very hot food in temperature and they nail it; i prefer my food extremely hot in spice too which they tend to be mellow on for my taste buds please sir chefgo on and hurt me with the magical indian spices its ok if i order a ten it should be blazing!! with all this said dhaba is unique in its offerings clean in presentation and overall a pretty good indian joint!! i will continue to eat there if you are an employee of any indian restaurant in arizona here me now you are from the continent asiatake a cue from your counterparts and give rice with dishes for free just plain white rice!! i do get irked that this cuisine charges for this plain starch dhaba is considered an authentic punjabi cuisine  i have been to many north indian cuisine restaurants and i have an idea of what most of the dishes are  unfortunately with the dhaba you would have some of the similar lingo but the name would be so long with other adjectives or punjabi words that confused the heck out of me  we finally figured out what we wanted and ordered from our cute waitress  we got the chana masala palak paneer and mutter paneer for breads we got garlic naan and something else with a sweet tastethe food was average at best and the portion sizes were extremely small  i had a groupon for $30 for $60 and i can see the groupon covering up the lack of quantity  the ambiance is this place is pretty well light and glowing for a nice date who wants to try ethnic cuisines  it is a decent place but i would not come here if you really hungry we went for dinner on a friday night when visiting family in the phoenix area  it was crowded but we didnt have to wait for a table  they have a very extensive menu with a lot of vegetarian and gluten free options  it took a while to figure out what to get though because there were so many things to read  plus because everything was in punjabi we had to read the descriptions of each dish  luckily there were papadams and chutneys to snack onall the dishes sounded really good!  we ended up getting the tandoori khazana with a mix of chicken and lamb tandoori that was super tasty  the lamb and the shrimp were succulent and flavorful and the chicken really captured the smoky tandoori flavor  our second dish was palak paneer and our third was the lamb korma  the paneer was pretty good and the spinach quite creamy and with just the slightest bit of heat  the lamb korma was awesome  the curry is similar to tikka masala but way better with cashews and raisins; the lamb was first rate in flavor and tenderness of the meat  we also ordered dessert: pistachio ice cream made on site  it was icy and delicious and melted in your mouth with an amazing creaminess  the pistachio flavor really shined in the dessert  we left stuffed!  what a great meal!the ambiance was very nice with beautiful colors and a warm feeling  the lighting was not too bright but not so dark that you couldnt see the food on your plate  the servers were chatty and pleasant but the cart they wheeled dishes out on seemed really out of placeoverall id come here again if i were in the area  a great experience and a delicious dinner ive been here a few times and always enjoy each visit first of all when you walk in you get an inviting feeling from the smiles  and courteousness of the staff you get to experience a bit of the culture with the lovely dining set they have and by the look of the decor and of course the many flavorful dishes that they offer! their staff pays attention to the water level of your cup and ensures it is filled thats an a+ :)this time around i tried papadum which is a  starter it looks like a tortilla but the texture is a light tortilla chip made of lentil powder rice powder and some different spices you can practically eat these non-stop! favorites/chicken/tandoors/bread/dessert:- rahon dal tarka which is yellow lentils mixed with different herbs and spices you can eat this with their saffron cumin rice - gudaspuri mutter paneer which is blended mix of peas and cheese along with the dhaba herbs and spices great for trying to fulfill the veggie part of your daily food intake! ;) palak paneer (spinach and cheese) is also good - gazab ka kadahi murgh which is a bbq boneless chicken marinated in a spicy yogurt this is my new favorite dish because its baked in their clay oven once cooked then its marinated in the yogurt sauce and mixed with onions bell peppers and tomato to create a wonderful sauce - tandoori murgh (chicken) cooked in the clay oven paired with onions and a squeeze of lemon - pani puri which is small finger foods street food  little chip-like texture cups filled with potatoes and chick peas pour the mint water in the filled cups and add an optional taramind sauce or mint sauce - garlic naan is hands down my favorite garlic naan i have tasted!! if youre wanting garlic naan then come here to eat it its soft  airy fluffy with the right amount of crispness on the edges and amount of garlic shavings on top! - ras malai (sweet condensed milk cheese circular chunks) homemade dessert think of fresh mozzarella cheese texture really soft clean texture mixed in with the condensed milk cream sauce - halwa which is a carrot fudge (sweet cooked carrot shavings boiled in condensed milk mixed with hints of pistachios cashews and golden raisins really innovative for a homemade dessert! overall i loved this place because i can always select new dishes as well as favorite dishes to eat and i can always expect great friendly service from their staff gotta come check this place out! mmm mmm gooddd! only thing i regret was not taking pics of the delicious foods!! next time ;) visiting phoenix from dc was hoping to find delicious indian food like we get in dc dhaba definitely delivered enjoyed all the dishes especially the lamb vindaloo and the palak paneer so glad we came!!!,3.8,5
India Oven,after being disappointed that the capriottis on sahara was closed i walked around and came across this restaurant when i first saw the store front it listed that they had a dinner buffet from 5pm to 10pm - woo-hoo! but when i walked in it turns out that they didnt have a buffet for dinner (at least for the night i came in - minus one star for false advertising!)its okay though because i ended up ordering the vegetarian thali which is almost like a mini buffet in itself - palak paneer channa masala rice pakora naan and kheer! it was all very good! i especially liked the channa masalathe interior of the restaurant was clean and well lit service was attentive - i always had a full glass of water yes okay so the waiters dont smile  that seems par for the course at every indian restaurant ive been to no big deal  they were out of the mushroom matar but the palak paneer was so tasty that i didnt mind  we were there with one friend who hadnt had a chance to try a lot of indian food so my friend and host ordered an appetizer sampler three types of naan and we shared  it was a fantastic experience everything was yummy when we pulled into the parking lot i was skeptical to be sure but inside clean-tastic decor from the 80s abounded the posse of owners presumably were very amicable and did not kick us out even though we were there just before closing samosas were decent and palak paneer appropriate garlic naan a plus but cheesy decor and too attentive wait staff made india oven exactly what it was for us- a last resort for indian cuisine we went to the lunch buffet to sample as many offerings as possible and i must say that some dishes were better than others but all were quite good the spices were quite adequate and it was all fresh and properly cooked this is a relatively unassuming place but the decor in no way interferes with the food or service the servers are quiet and polite and not in your face as in many near-strip places the buffet offerings were a good cross-section of indian food the tandoori chicken was well spiced and crispy if a bit dry ( it is a buffet after all ) my favorite dish was the palak paneer spinach with cheese it was the one absolutely perfect dish one i would order and eat just by itself it was a smooth creamy most delightful the samosas were crispy and fresh very nicely done all the curries were well spiced and well flavored the goat curry was cooked better than most places do as it had great texture and was cooked just enough and a mark of a nice indian restaurant was that the naan bread was buttery and fluffy and not flat nor burnt nor too heavy ( see my review on the samosa factory on how it is done poorly ) of course more expensive items like seafood were missing but considering the price that was to be expected so for an enjoyable lunch buffet this is really a bargain and if you can consume large quantities better for you now that the shalimar is no longer in town this is a good go-to standby certainly the best indian lunch offering cant wait to try the dinners overall review for the lunch buffet: mediocre but reasonably priced ($10-11)the buffet has a decent selection of rotating indian dishes but they are all surprisingly spice-less  the tandoori chicken was a little dry with a surprising lack of flavor; the curry goat and curry chicken -- muted flavor and spice-less; the palak paneer (spinach with cheese) -- nicely creamy but a little too buttery and spice-less; the samosas -- deliciously crispy but (you guessed it) spice-less; the chana masala (chick peas in masala sauce) was probably the highlight of the buffet but also spice-less  on a positive note they do offer free naan with the buffet  and naan does make everything better  that said if the location wasnt so convenient to downtown and the northern end of the strip i probably wouldnt go back my girl loves her some indian food so she suggested (by waking me up) that we should go to india oven for lunch and then some java afterwards myself i am not too big on indian restaurants so far i have limited exposure to them and the few i have been to recently have not really been that great however being the open-minded boyfriend i am i gave it the good fight and went along with her ideait was lunch time and they has a small all you can eat buffet for i think it was $10 or $11 btw it took me a bit to catch on that when people on yelp were saying ayce they meant all you can eat yea i guess i can be slow sometimes and btw means by the way just in case grins~ ok back to the subject lol - laughs out loud ;pas i was saying the buffet was small and limited and ranged from dried up meat kebabs to nice tender chicken tikka masala a mutton stew along with the various vegetarian dishes like palak paneer (spinach and farmers cheese) sabji samosas (vegetable fritters) daal makhni (creamed lentils) and a few others so overall the buffet was home to maybe 12-15 items and their naan bread does rock my girl also ordered the sweet lassi homemade yogurt drink which she lovedit was slow so the waiter was always there when we needed a drink refill and was courteous when doing so our bill came to $31 and some change for the two of us which is not bad for a lunch out to try something different but i still have to say i have yet to try for myself an indian restaurant in las vegas that i could not wait to go back to eat there againthat said i am sure that many of you would enjoy the food especially the vegetarian assortment of dishes and my girl says the dinner menu is betterbest regardsjames culinary schmooze williams indian food is one of my familys favorite types so we went here to try the place out and see how it was  inside were some indian themed wall paintings vases metalworking etc  we couldnt decide what to get so we just went for the buffet  the palak paneer was a bit mild (yet it was the buffet) nevertheless the food was rich with flavor  the owners were nice and showed us a back room where parties could be held  all in all the place was amazing one of the best local indian kitchens in the valley cant wait to come back for lunch! 1st off let me say that i do not know too much about indian foodi have eaten indian food at most only 6 times in my life  i only started eating it since last yearbut i know good buffet food when i eat it!this is the 1st time ive had an indian buffet but i am mostly scepticle about buffets all-together  but this one was very good for the money  (about $10 i think)nothing was too spicy but it was all very flavorful and freshive had better palak paneer but this was acceptable for a buffetwhatever the chicken was that they give you tableside it was deliscious!other people are giving it good solid reviews and i would have to agree   the service was great  (i hear that good service @ indian places is hard to find?)the inside decor was nice and the lighting was just fine  i had a really nice experience and some really good food update:      went there again last night and i loved it!   had the buffet again and tried more things and liked them all   they serve you some kind of awesome chicken on a skillet with your buffet order and now it seems like they serve you also some ground lamb kabob as well!   it was pretty goodthis time i also tried some of the desserts and those were freaking awesome too!  the desserts were very light but very flavorful  some type of mango custard and warm carrot dessert were my favoriteswhat a great price! ($10 dinner buffet w/ a coupon from the new times)  still have to say that the palak paneer is not the best  :(      but it is ok    seems like the place has picked up some business so good for them!   all of the wait-staff was very friendly and attentive  great service-nik jewel in the desert thats how i would start my review i have been living in the valley about 5 years and from past three years we stopped going to indian restaurant when you know a cuisine inside out you have your bars high this is how you feel most of the indian restaurants do good business but not great food but indian oven says you serve great food and also good business  i went on a week day and still found some great food here is the list they have 5+ both chicken and lamb and 8+vegi dishesif you count the dishes i will say easily18- 22now thats on week days the chicken makhini and lamb vindaloo were great and they also have indian meat ball curryawesome and you will not find it anywhere the palak paneer is authentic trust me you can still see the palak and its freshly made paneer do not forget to have all the deserts as every desert they have is the best and you need it after have some spicy food i would not be doing justice if i do not mention their freshly servedfreshly folks naan in the valleyyep they see you then they make it and its the best naan you can have  the taste and freshness of each dish and the authenticity is 5star and serving fresh tandoor on sizzler wants me to add another star        the people including the owner will ask you about the food and refill your water every single time they take care of you throughout the time if you are not going to this placeyou are not eating real indian food(period!!!) i felt the owners have set tehir bars very high fortheir food cleanliness and service and you can see that i wish india oven all the best and pray to god they stay forever tried the lunch buffet with some friends lots of good solid dishes lamb vindaloo was flavorful without being too spicy though the meat was a bit tough chicken curry was really good i thought the palak paneer and malai koftai were fine i really liked the paneer tikka masala; the paneer was cooked well and the flavor of the sauce was spot onservers walk around replacing garlic naan as needed on your table so you get it fresh though if youre with a group you might have to wait a little while i usually dont care for the desserts at indian restaurants especially buffets because the taste and quality make it appear as though they were an afterthought but the gulab janum were pretty solid at india oven i would probably skip the kheerservers were nice restaurant was clean and theres a full bar which was unexpected but nice if youre stopping in for dinner (or just want a really fun lunch!) i dont know if id make a special trip out here but if im in the area and want some indian food i would stop in again i really enjoyed this place! i had been here once before a while back with my mom but went back solo this time for the lunch buffetthey bring fresh garlic naan & sizzling tandoori chicken legs to your table the mango lassi (absolutely delicious & even a bit chilled to my surprise) is included at the buffet the vegetable samosas/pakoras are soooo tasty & crispy not soggy or greasy i always like to start with all the above & a bit of salad before digging into the curries and rice my choices for the curries were the chicken tikka masala which was great the palak paneer tastes really fresh the rice is really good & i loved the lentilsthe only thing i would change would be the lamb vindaloo its usually one of my favorites but it wasnt spicy enough & although the lamb was super tender its not really a vindaloo if it doesnt have a serious kick quick fix? the chili sauce by the salad & samosas can remedy this ;)i basically pigged out on lots of delicious food for $10 satisfied my craving for indian & read my book over my lunch hour in a nice quiet spot ill be back soon! :)-rageous i can be pretty picky about indian food and have been disappointed by several places around the valley this place on the other hand absolutely wowed me the dinner buffet had an exceptional number of choices on both the meat side and the vegetarian side the palak paneer was smooth and creamy and perfectly spiced same with the vegetable korma the spices were well-balanced very flavorful and an adventure for the tongue there was just the right amount of heat and as usual i cooled it down a bit with a spoonful of raita which was also delicious there was mango lassie on the buffet a great treat! my favorite dessert was there as wellgulab jamun try them! they are delicate balls of sweetness drifting in a wonderful syrup of cardamom and rosewater when we sat down with our first plate our server brought us a sizzling plate of tandoori chicken which was fantastic the host was friendly and checked on us several times to make sure we were happy and pleased with everything there is a bar with a decent selection of liquors although we had taj mahal beer that night the decor was fun to look at i cant find anything even mildly negative to say about this place ill be going back regularly i went for lunch on my day off been wanting to try this place for a while its location right next to a head shop is a little dubious but once you go in no worries the inside is clean nicely decorated; a few murals and tvs playing bollywood indian restaurants always flaunt a fully stocked bar with top end whiskeys and scotch does anyone ever drink there? the staff was extremely polite i was seated and went to the buffetall of the standard dishes were there the food was fresh the rice cooker with basmati in it had a cinnamon stick mixed in i thought that was cool tikka masala lamb vindaloo chicken curry  palak paneer (although it had baby corn in it instead interesting) aloo gobi and a few other veggie dishes all tasted great the dal was spicy but in a warm way the waiter brought garlic naan and tandoori chicken  which was excellent i love the desserts gulab jamun kheer  and mango custard all delicious there was also complimentary mango lassi which missed everything was great the servers were really on top of things without being pushy ill definitely make more stops here,3.857142857142857,14
Southern Spice,this review is from january 8 12 -- 3 of us went here for dinner yesterday we ordered the veg thali just to get an idea of how the food was the appetizer we got was the veg pakoda - not very bad but just ok - pretty bland though the soup had nothing but ginger in it we got 2 curries of our choice among us 3 we ordered bhindi masala palak paneer dal makhni paneer tikka masala kadai vegetable and mutter paneer other than the palak paneer nothing was even remotely good the plain naan was ok the rice was old the desert - gulab jamun - was burning hot but was not bad service was good but they definitely need to get a good cook one star is only for the service bottomline is food was very bad and i would never go there again,1.0,1
Chutney's Indian Cuisine,this review is based on a dinner experience (maybe the lunch buffet is great because you get to serve yourself)the food was goodbut not great the okra in the soup we ordered wasnt cooked thoroughly and was hard the flavors in the samosas were nice as was the palak paneerbut again it wasnt anything i couldnt get at the supermarket from a boxin addition most places include naan with your meal but at chutneys they charge 250 for two pieces seems like a rip offlets get to the worst part  our time spent in the restaurant - two hours this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things i think were missing naan  ohhh right    did you need anything else?  yes the soup?then at the end of our poorly timed meal plates still filled with food they brought the check didnt ask if we wanted dessert or boxesnow the guy who brings the water and bussed the table: he was on the ball! promote him to a server position because the girls leisurely walking around the restaurant? cant hack iti miss when this place was pasand : ( went for dinner on a fri night  service was lacking and so was the foodour waiter - nice kid but didnt know the first thing about the food  we were actually amazed that the owner wouldnt take more care in teaching the staff  the manager was there nonchalantly walking around but never offered any help or even stop by to see how things werewe ordered palak paneer lamb keema chicken tikka masala and egg curry  the palak paneer was probably the best dish  the keemas spices were overpowering and was hard to eat  the tikka masala was ok but seemed to be missing something  overall the food was just ok and wont warrant a return trip i have only had their saag / palak paneer one time but it has never tasted better!!! i try this dish at every indian joint and this is by far the best indian meal i have ever had i wish i lived closer so i could eat it on a regular basis,3.0,3
Flavors of India,this is my new favorite indian restaurant  anywhere  i had the lunch buffet which was delicious and after that i have mostly ordered palak paneer with naan and rice  theirs is fantastic!  so delicious!i love this place because it tastes so good and because it is close to home but the reason this place stands out among its peers is the service  this place has really really good service by any standard  waters get refilled promptly waiters are helpful  orders are accurate and the staff is really friendly  yay! i miss this place!we used to live around the corner from flavors of india and went here at least a couple times a monthfavorite dishes were malai kofta (sp?) and palak paneer my husband loved their lamb dishestheir lunch buffet was just okay could have a better selectionservice was always good they are sooo nice one time we ordered takeout and my husband who was sick at the time picked it up the girl at the counter offered him a little baggie of spices to help with his ailment how sweet and thoughtful! when we eat in for dinner we enjoy the indian beer and my husband really enjoys the bollywood music videos hmmm could it be the completely gorgeous indian women dancing around in saris? i have been here a few times but mainly at dinner  dinner has always been great great waiters and staff with a lcd tv playing almost famous famous bolywood movies  lol  it cracks me up when they dancelolanyhow great vegetarian choices for people who eat there veggies but trust me i am a meat eater  chicekn tika masala little dry but still good  my favorite is there palak paneer great for the vegetarian  i have also tried there lunch buffet for 1100  i give a thumbs up  good serve yourself and pig out!!!!!! one of the best indian buffets in the valleylove their chicken makhani (butter chicken) it makes an appearance on their buffet table fairly frequently (as much as i love tikka masala its a nice change) their naan palak paneer and chana masala are all perfect cooked and seasoned service is quick and friendly one of my favorite spots to go for lunch go now:),4.5,4
Taj Mahal Indian Cuisine,went for lunch buffet around 1:30p about a month ago and found the selections to be sparse and on the dry-side  out of the 7 or so hot dishes i could only try about 3 or 4 due to my food allergies and i only enjoyed the tandoori chicken (which there were only five pieces in the tray the entire time i was there; three of which i consumed) and the palak paneer (spinach and cheese dish)  i was able to request a freshly-prepared samosa and dosa too!  (yes sir this punjabi restaurant is branching out and preparing southern dishes like dosa!)indian buffets are so hazardous to my waistline (and cardiovascular system!) since i love the flavors so much!  i also have a massive sweet-tooth and taj mahal serves great gulab jamun and carrot halwa!  oh-oh i may just have to swing by this weekend of mine (a little earlier this time around to see if the selections look and taste a little fresher) for a little splurging! 5 stars  im indian and ive reviewed more indian restaurants in the valley than probably anyone on yelp i was not expecting this place to be so good based on the earlier reviews however there is a reason the food is much better; new ownership (including new chefs) took over 20 days ago this is probably the reason the last 3 reviews were 5 stars because they were within the period when the new owners took over the food is truly worth 5 stars and i was debating if it was better than guru palace for the best indian restaurant in the valley and guru palace slightly edges it but its closethe malai kofta is the best in the city and replaces royal taj has having the best the chicken tikka masala was flavorful and had a perfectly nice tomato flavor as opposed to just tasting like cream the palak paneer had the perfect texture but it was slightly underseasoned and undercooked but still very good i still think royal taj has the best palak paneer in the city  the only real complaints were the naan and rice dont get me wrong it was good but ive had much better naan elsewhere it was a little hard and thin but still tasted fresh  the rice was fairly standard of most of the indian restaurants in phoenix in that it was dry(overcooked) and had too much cumin thus far guru palace has the best rice in the citythey did the little things well my kingfisher ale was served in a chilled glass and the beer itself was cold sometimes indian restaurants can serve warm beer the papad wasnt burned and it was crisp and non greasy the service and vibe was nice it seems to be owned by a young indian couple who were very nice they speak great english are very trendy and friendly the wife served us and she was great and very friendly the restaurant was really clean and spacious as well which were pluses also the location was easy to find its at the southeast corner of mckellips and scottsdale rd in south scottsdalethe owners mentioned they will be renovating the inside so i have a feeling it will look more trendy and resemble guru palace and dhaba however its fine as it is now because its really clean albeit slightly bare i would say its in the top 3 and the only other 5 star indian restaurant in the valley besides guru palace and royal taj my dining partner and i had purchased a groupon to taj mahal and were excited to use it we finally got the opportunity tonight i ordered the palak paneer and he ordered the lamb rogan josh we also ordered rice and naan to go along with the dishes the food was pretty good although if and when we go back wed both want to try something new however the naan was outstanding perfect texture and delicious tastewhile the food was good our waitress was excellent she was very friendly and eager to help with recommendations throughout the meal she stayed attentive to our needs but was not interrupting us every few minutesi hope to return sometime in the near future and try another dish or two it is very rare for me to give an indian restaurant a 5 out of 5 star  i guess i have very high expectations of indian places since i am indian so it takes a lot to impress me  i came here with a groupon with one of my friends who loves indian food we ordered a simple 2 entree 2 bread and rice portion  we went vegetarian with palak paneer (my favorite dish) malai kofta garlic naan and whole wheat roti  the palak paneer which is a spinach dish had an interesting twist with how the spinach was blended into the seasonings  usually the spinach looks kind of boiled  i was a little worried by that but it tasted amazing  i havent ordered malai kofta much but it tasted similar to previous experiences which is always a good thing  both dishes had the right amount of seasoning and medium spice as we requested  both bread dishes met my expectationsthe service was excellent which is not common in a lot of indian restaurants that i have been to in arizona  the price was also very reasonable  i am going to give another try for this place during lunch time for their $10 lunch buffets 3 of us went here for dinner yesterday we ordered the veg thali just to get an idea of how the food was the appetizer we got was the veg pakoda - not very bad but just ok - pretty bland though the soup had nothing but ginger in it we got 2 curries of our choice among us 3 we ordered bhindi masala palak paneer dal makhni paneer tikka masala kadai vegetable and mutter paneer other than the palak paneer nothing was even remotely good the plain naan was ok the rice was old the desert - gulab jamun - was burning hot but was not bad service was good but they definitely need to get a good cook one star is only for the service bottomline is food was very bad and i would never go there again,3.6,5
Bombay Palace,meh service is attentive and eager but not too competent (eg we ordered cabernet and got tepid chardonnay) food was so-so not as good as delhi palace the spinach part of the palak paneer was reminiscent of school lunch spinach (maybe canned?); the amount of sauce in the lamb and chicken dishes was disproportionate to the meat--there were only a few bites of meat to a good 15 cups of sauce none of the three curries or the birjani was memorable,2.0,1
Woodlands Vegetarian South Indian Kitchen,note: ignore the reviews above it looks as if there is some deliberate attempt by the udupai owners to pose as members and bash this place yes this owner used to own udupai cafe and udupai cafe is another dosa house that competes with this eatery  if you read my other reviews you know that im critical and  my attention to detail is there so im not one of these people who likes every place he eats atpositivesim indian and i can assure you this place is good i have never been to udupai cafe but based on its failing health inspections i would be scared to eat there woodlands is a nice clean eatery in a nice part of chandler  its not a restaurant  its basically a dosa shop they  specialize in dosa and offer several types they also have excellent indian chinese dishes   the food is consistently good and i have eaten there on several occassions  this is a lunch/light dinner place  dont think of this place like a restaurant  there are several types of dosa and thats what this place specializes in  the restaurant is also modern and not is some ghetto strip mall so dont worry about failing health codes hereat least not for a whilenegativestheir non-south indian dishes are not so good for non-indians they should be informed that this is a dosa house so order dosa and other south indian dishes  dont order your typical indian restaurant favorites like palak paneer (it wasnt good here)   the owner also says every dish is excellent which isnt true; he is kind of a businessman so he doesnt really care about telling you which dishes stand out  stick to the dosa and the vegetable manchurian  their mango shake wasnt very good their chiku shake is great been to this location many times (both lunch & dinner) and the food is always good and filling  im a huge fan of indian food (both north & south) and this place is right up my alley  great food great prices speedy serviceand always made to feel welcome by the friendly lady behind the counterive even ordered food from here for a company luncheon event and everyone loved it  have taken many out-of-town guests here and everyone is always impressed w/the food  ive been to many other indian restaurants around the valleybut this is the one i always come back tothe following are some of my favorites from this restaurant:curry eggplantpalak paneermalai koftavegetable manchuriannaandosa i really enjoyed the food here we stopped in for a casual dinner after being highly recommended i left happy and way more full than i had anticipated all those light airy dhosas are deceptively fillinganother reviewer was on point by saying that this spot isnt really a restaurant but more of an eatery or dhosa shop you order at a counter take a seat and your food is brought out to you pitchers of water are self-serve and there is of course a soda fountain there is also a chutney bar where you can explore to your hearts content we brought a sample of each back to the table each were delicious and fresh i got the palak paneer which was delicious my friend ordered one of the giant table-sized dhosas of which they were happy to tone down the spice at her request all in all everything was great the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was the plastic everything our food was served in dixie bowls and all the silverware was plastic it sort of felt like we were camping the space is clean and bright i think some real dishes and silverware would really round this place out at any rate i will be back woodlands is one of my favorite places to grab lunch i first learned about it from a fellow indian coworker who was vegetarian and that was the only place he frequented  its a pretty plain joint (not too big on the decorations youll note) but the food is outstandingly flavorful  now dont be fooled and think that just because its vegetarian that it is going to be completely healthy that is a very common mis-conception and can really eff up your diet if you have that mindset and eat at places like this frequently cuz i tell ya they are pretty generous with not only the portions but to give food some sustenance you can bet they use cream or ghee (basically butter) to thicken sauces up and the likes  this food is flavorful for sure but low in calories it is noti have tried a few of their thalis (basically sampler dishes which lets you try a variety of things in one sitting and in smaller portions but still really filling) the palak paneer the currys the aubergine dish called bharwan baiga gobi manchuria they were all super delicious though the aubergine dish is still my favorite!plan on taking leftovers oh yeah and the prices are pretty decent and the staff is pretty good too what this place lacks in interior design it makes up for in deliciousness! like other reviewers have said this is not a fancy place the person who takes your order is not the most outgoing guy on earth if you want water you grab a pitcher that they probably bought at wal-mart and drink your water from a small styrofoam dixie cup you eat off of styrofoam plates and bowls i dont care the food is awesome and you get a ton of it for the price id eat at this place if i had to sit on the floor and eat with my handsi always order the palak paneer - its very good and super spicy i love it so much im afraid to try anything else the meal comes with rice (im not sure if they all do though) if you want bread its extra great food and well worth the drive to chandler! i work at intel down the road and me and my coworker order from this place once a week! the palak paneer masala butter paneer and the gobi manchurian are freaking amazing! the guy at the counter which i believe is the owner is always really nice and says hey youre that guy from intel you still working? we usually call up the order and go pick it up 15 minutes later definitely highly recommend this place if you like indian food,4.5,6
Maharaja Restaurant,you know i am usually highly suspicious of buffets  i took microbiology in college and really it was enough to scare me away from buffets forever  id almost rather eat off a toilet seat than a buffetthat being said the buffet at maharaja rules!  i really always thought i hated indian food because i dont like curry  i usually stick to tandoori chicken and the bread  last time i went i got adventurous and tried the tikka masala  yum!  i also love those little balls soaked in syrup  so i tried other things too like little veggie fritters and palak paneer  i am also now addicted to mango lassis  the staff is very friendly and thankfully keeps the buffet fresh  this is one buffet i cant wait to come back to,5.0,1
Passage To India,this is our 3rd time at passage to india we have eaten dinner twice and enjoyed the buffet once every time has been wonderful tonight we had palak paneer and malai kofta as well as garlic naan the malai kofta is the best we have ever had and my husband and i eat a lot of indian food the palak paneer was delicious as well last time we got everything hot but it was really to hot for us (despite loving hot spicy food) so we went with medium this time and that was perfect one of our favorite things is the bar when you order a margarita they bring you your drink and extra its like getting 2 drinks for the price of one service has always been great and we have gotten our food very quickly though we are not of indian heritage most of the clientele is  always a good sign! i had a great experience!  it was my 12 year old daughters first time eating indian food so i asked the server what she recommended for a 12 year old eating indian food for the first time and she was very helpful  we ended up ordered samosas tandoori chicken makhni and palak paneer and a side order of nan  the food was excellent and i couldnt have asked for better service  the gentleman who seated us made sure we had fresh rice for our left overs and brought over some foil for our bread  our tea glasses never went empty  i was very very very happy with my service and food  i would be back again!,5.0,2
India Garden,i was a little concerned because one reviewer said that they found a roach in their food  i have to say that this place is really cleaned  maybe it was just an isolated incident or maybe the reviewer wanted to hurt business at this place im not really sure  i have to say though that this was an incredibly clean restaurant  even their bathrooms were spotless  the food here was amazing as well  i had the lunch buffet with the palak paneer getting my specific attention  it was very flavorful as well as some of the other items on the buffet line  the service was really good as well  extremely attentive and fast,4.0,1
Dhaba Indian Bistro,unexpected delicious lunch at a place i never heard of i had this incredible platter (thali) of fabulous vegetarian dishes every dish was distinct and robust the platter included rice chana masala vegetable korma and palak paneer all was accompanied by a flaky naan and gajar halwah for dessert i need to bring my pakistani boyfriend aka significant other partner boy toy or whatever you call your guy at age 60 the next time i come i would be interested in his takei plan to take home significant leftovers so he can try them tomorrow,5.0,1
Royal Taj,i was totally jonesing for indian food and since none of my friends like indian food i decided to go solo  thats always an awkward thing but i was undeterred in my quest!ive been to royal taj many times and it is consistently good  the naan is fabulous the chicken tikka masala is always tender and delicious and the palak paneer is incredibleits not one of those places to go if youre looking for outstanding service or ambience but the food is always great! im indian and have eaten at several of the indian restaurants in the valley yes i recognize that indian restaurants in phoenix generally suck  so with that in mind royal taj is the second best indian restaurant in the valley (guru palace is #1) in another city with quality indian restaurants this restaurant would get 35 to 4 starts but for phoenix its the best  its a true indian punjabi restaurant that makes great malai kofta chicken tikka masala palak paneer boti kebob and tandoori chicken  they serve their tandoori dishes on sizzling clay plates which even nice restaurants like dehli palace (tempe: university and rural) doesnt dothat being said the restaurant isnt without its flaws its located in an abandoned strip mall that can feel unsafe at times with strange people walking around  in addition the restaurant had a bad odor the other night  the service needs improvement  there is essentially one server for the entire restaurant (the wife of the cook) she is very sweet but doesnt speak english well but she understands english perfectly  the lamb is a little dry  i would stick to their curries with all of this being said it is the second best indian restaurant in the valley  a lot of the so-called indian restaurants like tandoori times are really pakastani restaurants which is a different style of cuisine that specializes in more grilled items but uses less spices and sauces its also not a south indian restaurant posing as a north indian restaurant went for the lunch buffet the garlic naan was pretty much the best i had in phoenix they had basmati rice daal palak paneer (saag paneer) potatoes and mushrooms paneer chicken makhani another type of chicken( which was the best dish) and tandoori chicken(not really great)over all a really good indian buffet in the phoenix area will probably go back again im giving first place back to royal taj after less than stellar experiences at guru palace (60 and gilbert) and taj mahal (mcdowell and scottsdale) royal taj is getting back my vote for the best indian restaurant in the valley in case you havent followed my reviews im an indian food connoisseur and have been to nearly indian restaurant in the valley in my opinion royal taj guru palace and taj mahal are in the top 3 indian restaurants in the valley im not one of these clueless guys who judges a restaurant by how many selections were offered at the buffet its about quality not quantity and i dont eat at buffets because you are getting the watered down spiceless stuff they serve to the mainstream  the food was truly outstanding and i think word is finally getting around because the place was packed the chicken tikka masala got the perfect blend of creaminess and smoothness to the curry that guru palace and taja mahal lacked the palak paneer is the best in the city and its truly unique in that they dont mix cheap pieces of broccoli and pure into a soup its the real dealreal spinach with no filler the naan was excellent as always everything is pretty good on this menu again the only knock on this place is its ambience its a hole in the wall but then against so are most chinese and mexican places (the good ones anyway) so if you are truly about great indian food come here,4.75,4
Gaylord India Restaurant,remarkably good surprisingly good remarkably surprisingly good we had dinner here on a random thursday night and were amazed at how good the food was the service was friendly and fun too had the veggie samosas (delicious) lamb curry (mmmmm) palak paneer (tasty) and some rice (frangrant and yummy)the only down side was the family sitting behind us which i believe owned the place--the guy was the guy from the picture of the restaurant and the younger guy seemed like he owned the place their grand-daughter was crawling all over the floor and making a huge mess which i found distracting and mildly irritating but man this was some good indian food and it hit the spot,4.0,1
India's Grill,when i entered at normal dinner time there was only 2 other customers than my party  i was really worried that the food would be horrible and a waste of a groupon  i ordered the usual dishes i would get with my parents (garlic naan onion kulcha mattar paneer palak paneer and chana masala)  each of the dishes had an unique taste than what i expected  it tasted different but it was goodmy major negative is we asked for medium spice and the food was very mild  in addition i had to try really hard to try the garlic in the garlic naan  the food comes in decent portion but it might be a couple bucks overpriced per dishi would come here again to try some non-vegetarian dishes or the buffet,3.0,1
Mint Indian Bistro,as usual everything was delicious!  we get the watermelon mintini chicken tika masala palak paneer lamb vindaloo vegatable raita and the bhatura (sp?) whatever we dont finish we bring home and it tastes even better the next day! i went here to meet up some friends for late lunch and surprisingly there was still a wait at 1:45pm they have an ipad by the door so you can put your name down and the number of people in your party i waited 10 minutes which isnt badwe came here for the lunch buffet since ive been hearing good things our naan took a rather long time but at least they gave us unlimited garlic naan theres another indian restaurant a few miles away from here that also has a lunch buffet but that place turned me off when they kept giving me excuses as to why they cant give me garlic naan (ie we ran out of garlic when theres a supermarket right behind them) this place is in a better location and looks nicer and cleaner the service is better too for less than $15 for a buffet you cant go wrongi liked that theres a good variety of dishes for their lunch buffet: tikka masala palak paneer tofu veggies spicy chicken curry and other savory dishes their gulab jamun was just right - hot sweet and cheesy balls yum! the food was excellent hooray for huge chunks of chicken! the sauces were spot on there was this mystery dish that we all tried without reading the label - was it cheese or was it tofu? it was the texture of cubed mozzarella without the stomach ache-inducing property of cheese on somebody whos lactose intolerant so it probably was tofuill definitely come back again and again,5.0,2
Tandoori Village,hands down one of the best indian places ive been towhen it comes to restaurants im more of a food-over-service kind of girl the service decor and ambiance dont really matter to me so much as a good meal doesthis place is nothing to look at i think it was a fried chicken shack before tandoori village took over it- and it still looks like it the waiters are teenagers du jour and are acceptable but you might have to flag one down to get your chai or water refilled but like i said that hardly matters when my 5-star review is all about the foodto start order hot chai it will come unsweetened and very hot- but stir and stir with sugar while you wait for your meal youll find yourself strangely addicted to a second cup even if you dont like whole milk (i detest it and this is the only time i drink it)the naan basket is fantastic- a variety of flavored naans onion garlic potato also fantastic is the papadum- its like a flat crispy cracker flavored with indian spices try it with the two chutneys- the green one is mint and hot the other is sweeter and earthier also try mixing them!i love the palak paneer- a spinach dish made with indian cheese- and the basmati rice the vindaloo is also amazing their curries and sauce dishes will share a little easier than their tandoori or grilled dishes- get a variety of sauces and meats and trade around the table for a little sample of everything i always leave a little high on spice and very satisfied its nothing special to look at but it really depends on what you go in wanting if you want a slice of india complete with belly-dancers and ornate carpets you might want to try somewhere else but for fantastic food at reasonable pricesthis is your place!,5.0,1
Royal India Bistro,we went to the $14 (11am to 4pm) lunch buffet  we had been there twice before for dinner when it was gaylord and both experiences were quite similar; nice ambiance good but overpriced food lousy service  so i was excited they were back (same owners new name) and could do a major affordable chow down and not have to worry about the service because it was a buffet  really what could possibly go wrong?so there we are-nobody to seat us-so i poke my head into the dining area and someone comes and ushers us to a table in a near empty room  i look around; wow design fallout!  the gaylord to india bistro remodel is more of a demodel what was once a rather upscale and attractively appointed space has been dehabbed with cheesy booths and a tacky over bright chandelier oh well moving onthe buffet consisted of: dal maharani  baingan pakoras (eggplant) aloo baingan (think it was potato and eggplant) palak paneer  basmati rice tandoori chicken chicken tikka masala chicken curry and some expired salada little heavy on the chicken and eggplant but i was still ok with thatuntil i discovered that every chicken dish was a contender for the food despair jackpot  the one commonality they all shared was their styrofoam taste and consistency  it was the worst rice i have ever had and we debated if it was old or undercooked settling on the notion that it was probably both  everything else pretty much sucked as well  there are people starving in (fill in the blank) and they would probably choose hunger over that buffet  the only plus:our server kept us attentively stocked with the only palatable things we had:garlic naan & water,1.0,1
India Gate,im starting to get the hang of indian food and as george costanza would say: im loving it !  so when a friend suggested an indian buffet i was all over it  india gate is great not pretentious or over the top with a good sized menu oh but i didnt want the menu georgie i wanted the buffetit had all of my favorites like palak paneer and matter paneer plus some new favorites like the minced lamb and green chutneyi love their lunch buffet and stop by at least twice a month but i was unimpressed with the lamb vindaloo entree from the menu the lamb was tough and had gristle boo gristle hooray beer!,4.0,1
Taj Palace,tried their lunch buffet today and thought it was pretty goodthe upside: they have a variety of dishes and choices for vegetarians:yellow dal(they had a name for this dish but i forgot)-it was yellow lentils and squash with tamarind and spicesreally really yummy i had 2 helpingspalak paneer-spinach and cottage cheese-very good its a bit spicy though i love spicy food and found it a little extra spicypotato and peas-goodchana masala-good but very oilybhindi-was ok (i make bhindi better;)pakora-i had one and thought it was too much oil tasted okthey had a couple of more vegetarian dishes(i think 6 in all) and 4 chicken/lamb dishes and rice that i did not try was told that they were quite goodi also tried the mango chutney and coriander chutney which tasted great they had several more condiments available the raita/yogurt with cucumber tasted good toothe server brought water and asked us what kind of naan we wanted unfortunately they did not have tandoori roti which is a healthier bread but who am i kidding(theres nothing healthy about the meal well with the exception of the salad spinach and  yogurt i guess:)we got naan - and it was good it had a generous helping of butter so we requested one without and he brought it out quickly the naan was crisp fresh and tasted amazing!the restaurant was quite busy but the server did a good job keeping our glasses filled with water and asking if we needed anything elseits definitely one of the better indian meals ive had here in vegas ordered take out the other night we asked the guy taking the order what their best chicken dish was and he suggested karahi chicken ended up ordering karahi chicken palak paneer dal makhaninaan and roti for our guestswhen we brought home the order we realized they had given us shahi or karahi paneer instead of the chicken i called back and the guy was apologetic and offered to deliver the chicken to us since the order had taken over 40 minutes and it was a busy saturday night we offered to come and pick it up4 points for customer service as they compensated by giving us a complimentary pulao rice and some achar relish and corrected the order2 points for the food however:dal makhani-was extra creamy but tasted the best of the lotpalak paneer-was okchicken karahi-which they claimed was the best chicken option was flavorless and pretty tastelesspulao-was not bad pretty decentnaan and roti were well madethey let us keep the paneer karahi as well but unfortunately that was pretty tasteless tooi usually love leftover food the next day but this i was happy to get rid offi will try them again as this may have been a freak day since they were busy but it was disappointing considering our guests were looking forward to a nice indian meal and price wise the place is not cheap! i guess i will stick to the buffet for this one as somehow the buffet experience has been ok every time but have not had the same luck with take out orders,3.5,2
Tandoori Times Indian Bistro,my belief has always been that at a restaurant nothing matters but the food  service can be abysmal as long as the food is good  tandoori times has changed my beliefs about this and i now realize that service can be so amazingly terrible that it can completely ruin a dining experiencedinner started innocently enough  we sat at a table not far from the bar and our server started out asking us what wed like to drink  the server had a young kid with her maybe 5-6 years old and the kid was helping her with things  i thought it was kind of strange but i assumed it was probably our servers kid and that she couldnt find a babysitter for the night or something - no big deali ordered a dirty martini and our server went back to the bar to mix our drinks (she told us the bartender had already gone home for the night even though it was only 6pm)  since our table was near the bar we could hear what was going on there and within a minute or two i heard the server asking the rest of the staff if they knew where the olive juice was  after a minute or two of searching the staff concluded that they were out of olive juice  at this point i expected our server to come back and ask if she could get me a different drink  she didnt  instead she started asking the staff what she could substitute for olive juice and they concluded that saltwater would be good  ugh  she brought me the drink and pretended it was completely normal and nothing was wrong  i pretended i didnt know any better took a sip of the drink and told her it was beyond awful and it tasted like they had used salt instead of olive juice  she acted like she couldnt imagine why this was and she said that she would take the drink off of my bill  when she picked the drink up from the table to take it away the young kid i mentioned earlier bumped into her and knocked the drink out of her hand  she spilled a bit of it on me and most of it on the floor  she then walked away and offered no help of any kind - no napkins or anything  this spilled drink stayed on the floor _the entire rest of the meal_ and they never cleaned it up  when we eventually left i was tempted to slip on it pretend i severely hurt myself and start yelling about how careless their staff was how they could be held liable for injuries blah blah blah  i just wanted someone to recognize that it was ridiculous for them to not clean up things that they had spilled but it really seemed like they didnt care at allanyway the server asked if i wanted something else to drink instead  i went for a gin and tonic  when she got back to the bar the first thing i heard was whats in a gin and tonic? how do i make one? sigh  anyway the gin and tonic turned out okay all things considered but at this point i was pretty sad from what had already happenedfinally we got to ordering our food  our server came over asked what wed like and as we started telling her we noticed she wasnt paying any attention  she was just watching her kid and talking to her  so we got to repeat our order again and this time she actually paid attention and wrote it down  yayawhile later our food came out - we got two naans (one paneer one chicken) chicken tikka masala palak paneer and rice  the naans were pretty average nothing really special  the chicken tikka masala was actually pretty good and was the only decent part of the whole meal  the palak paneer was some of the worst ive ever had and im pretty sure they just emptied a defrosted bag of frozen spinach over some cubes of paneer  it tasted like no spices or any kind of flavoring had been addedin the middle of eating we were interrupted by the server and her kid for a rather awkward moment  the server made her kid apologize for knocking over my drink and then they walked away  congratulations tandoori times on making our dinner that much more uncomfortableour server didnt seem to care about anything throughout the whole meal - she never asked how anything was if we needed anything etc when we were done eating she came by and dropped off the check without removing our plates from the table or even saying a word  we had been charged an extra $250 just to have rice with our entrees which i think is pretty ridiculous  anyway i took out my credit card and she came by to pick it up again without saying a word  we left quickly wanting to get our tandoori times experience over with as soon as possiblewhen we left i was pretty frustrated and angry which is not how one should feel when leaving a restaurant  i will never ever ever come back here again imagine if you were pakastani and you wanted to open a restaurant that would cater to the mainstream you would make it trendy inside you would offer a nice bar you would hire american people as your servers and you would make the food not so spicy in essence you would create the pf changs of indian food you would give it an indian sounding name like tandoori times and remove any vestiges of pakistan as indian restaurants are better recognized and thus seen as a safer option among the mainstream  well thats exactly what tandoor times is being indian i prefer indian food meaning i like all the grilled meat items but they better be able to make quality sabjis and vegetarian dishes too  tandoori times is a pakastani restaurant; its not an indian restaurant its almost the same but their dishes are different pakastani cuisine involves tandoori items and grilled items their cooking style is less spicy and offers less cream in their dishes  indian (punjani/north indian) food involves tandoor items as well in addition to vegetable dishes more variety and types of curries and is spicier and more flavorful in general if you are a non-vegetarian like myself you can survive on the curries and the shish kebob and other meat items however when you taste their chaat deserts and vegetarian sabjis this restaurant clearly does not know what they are doing  if you are vegetarian of indian descent you will be sorely disappointed  nothing against pakastani cuisine but vegetarian dishes are not your forte much like curries and grilled options are not really a part of south indian cooking  the food is on the mild side of course if you ask them to make something hotter they can but their food in general is not very spicy and is bland with the exception of some of their curries  if you are a non-indian and you want to try indian food for the first time this would be a good place to start if you are someone who has eaten quality indian food and wants the real thing avoid this place because this is as far from being the real thing as possible the service and ambience was quite nice i think thats the real draw of this restaurant since most indian restaurants have poor service and often a dirty or claustrophobic environment  this is a trendy restaurant in old town scottsdale that you could take a date to  the service was good when we went there but at the same time the servers were pretty ignorant of the menu and didnt know a lot about indian foodbeing indian this place was just a bunch of hype  yes it was neat to see friendly american people serving indian food since im used to indian waiters who are abrupt and to the point  i liked the ambience but the food was disappointing their palak paneer honestly tasted as if some non-indian person decided to try and make it from a cookbook at home it was not spicy nor was it cooked properly their malai kofta was not even malai koftalets put it that way  i will say this their tandoori chicke was probably the best ive had in the valley and thats not suprising since pakastani cooking involves meat and they know how to grill meat well but outside of their meat dishes it was completely lackluster the bottom line is that if you are an indian person or a person who is used to eating quality indian food and you want honest to goodness quality indian (not pakastani) food avoid this place  if you are a non-indian person wanting to check out indian/pakastani food and just want to have a good time this place is for you  note however that the prices are rather high for an indian/pakastani restaurant so you are paying for that ambience,2.0,2
Al Hamra,palak paneer and benghan bartha were wayyy too salty for anyones taste not sure if it was msg or salt but it left us feeling a little ill after dinner and we could barely eat any of it  the garlic naan was delicious and the rice was good the waitress seemed hurried and not as hospitable as one would expect no lack of flavors at this restaurant the naan was some of the best ive ever had other notables were the bhindi masala palak paneer and aloo ghobithe tandoori meats were delicious all items are cooked to your spice level we chose four and that was plentyhalfway through dinner i shifted into sport-eating mode and got myself one helluva tummy ache on the drive home it was that goodim paying for it today well not really my wife is,3.0,2
Curry Garden,first time here and the food was delish  we had tikki masala chicken curry and palak paneer  next time well skip the chicken curry and double up on the masala - it was super yum  i dont care for palak paneer in general - but this had a really nice deep rich spiced flavor   garlic naan was very good - and the rice comes with the food (and extra for $99 - not the $3-4 for rice some places charge)   they said the veggie korma came with brocolli - which i cant eat - so i didnt get to try one of my favorite things - time to find a new favorite thing!dont expect fancyness or great decor - but thats ok - delish food and the silly quirky new waitress made up for it delicious!!!  i love indian food (actually i love most food) but i dont do very well with really spicy foods  hubs and i found this place on grub hub and thought what the heck well give it a whirl  and once we started we cant stop  we order from this place nearly every week!  everything weve ordered has been absolute perfection  we can specify the level of spiciness (so i dont die) and the only and let me emphasize only downfall is there is a bit of a wait for the food  but its so worth it that it doesnt even warrant subtracting half a star  :)weve tried many menu items but our favorite is the palak paneer  most places you have to really dig to find those yummy little cheese cubes  not here!  this is stuffed to overflowing with fantastic little bites  also the cucumber sauce is to die for! i could eat that cold and plain as a soup almost!  in fact i did one nightthe restaurant is small but always very clean and the owner/staff have always been super-friendly  this place is a little gem in chandler and i will definitely be back for more!,4.5,2
Origin India Restaurant & Bar,i was craving indian food so i googled indian restaurants this place had a good rating so i thought id give it a try   there palak paneer was really spicy didnt like it very disappointed its not suppose to be spicy palak paneer is my ultimate favorite indian dish! so i was sad! my husband got the chicken tiki masala not realizing its $16 just for chicken in masala sauce!!!! it was good chicken was a little tuff though $16 for that is just ridiculous!!! tried the lemon rice and it was terrible! no flavor and way to many poppy seeds! who wants seeds in there rice!? not me tried the garlic nan (tortillas) that was good! so for two dinners w/rice and tortillas we spent $45 that is just outrageous! food is not that great prices are ridiculous!!!! and its far from my house wont be going back!,2.0,1
Indian Delhi Palace,my husband is the fan of indian food and i had a gift certificate from some students so we gave indian delhi palace a try  the service was spotty depending on who was in our section at the time  the naan and puri were excellent and both of our entrees were tasty (my husband had the chicken tikka masala and i had a mild lamb dish in cream sauce the jasmine rice was beautiful and well cooked but also had cardamom seeds in it (not my favorite) my husband loved his palak paneer we agreed that overall we have had a little better food and service from taste of india fantastic chicken tikka masala and garlic naan!  gulab jamun is good but not the best ive had  i didnt like the palak paneer  service is friendly and efficient  preparation of food can take awhile so dont arrive starving  lunch buffet available and you can even take lunch buffet to-go!  (havent tried it yet though so i cant vouch for the food served)ooh ive got to get this on my rotation soon! we stopped in here for the ubiquitous lunch buffet and i am a little torn because i wanted to either really like it or really hate it but i dont it seems that decent indian is hard to come by out here so i tend to stick with the same couple of placesmy usual indian haunt is flavors of india because the food is mostly good and its close but i think this place is a close second the things that flavors does well delhi palace does so so on and vice versa where delhi palace shines: (within the confines of todays buffet of course) palak paneer- even though the paneer was noticeably absent or microscopicbengan bhartha- my eggplant-hating dining companion even liked it mutter paneer- the one dish with peas that ill eat willingly the service- they werent in your face but they were around more than most buffet meals the atmosphere- its classy without being over the top gaudy where flavors of india kicks delhi palaces hiney: naan- i prefer the flattened nearly scorched naan to the fluffy puff that was plopped on the table here it was fresh though so bonus points for that tandoori chicken- the flavor was fantastic but the meat was dry yellow lentil daal- ill save my colorful description of this one and just leave it at blech curry chicken- wheres the spice? possibly the blandest curry chicken ever the water- this sounds weird but every time the server came by to refill water we ended up with more ufos (unidentifiable floating objects) in our glasses overall i think its a toss-up the things that i like about delhi palace are the things that my old stand by place doesnt do well ill definitely be back but not for the curry or lentils in my mind there are two types of indian restaurants in the valley that i can afford to eat at  theres the ones in strip malls that typically feature a grouchy old man behind the counter and a huge tv displaying indian mtv or soap operas and largely do-it-yourself service (see: kohinoor)if im feeling like spoiling myself ill take the next jump up to the places with painted walls friendly waitstaff and a-la-carte style menus instead of specialsafter a long day at work and in hippy progressive meetings me and my beyonce decided to try indian delhi palace which is an excellent example of the latterthe waiters were attentive without  being overbearing and the complimentary appetizer - i always forget the name - the crispy slightly sweet cracker thingamajig with the green sauce? - was yummy  and the samosas we started off with were also great  not overly greasy or soggy or stale like a lot of indian placesthe palak paneer is wonderful!  ask for it spicy if you are a fan of spicy foods  the creamy spinach flavor doesnt become overbearingly hot but has a pleasant spicy aftertaste that mixes perfectly with their garlic naan served fresh of the soft and chewy variety that i preferre: the people who miss paneer the paneer was definitely on the skimpy side but i didnt mind  the taste was definitely still there - perhaps they blend it in more than other restaurants?  anyway if you are a huge fan of blocks of paneer in your food you might want to mention as such to your serverthe lady ordered vegetable bhriyani which is sort of our indian comfort food and it didnt disappoint  flavorful rice with tons of veggiesindian delhi palace has good food good service and an atmosphere that will embrace you like a vampire who feeds off of stress instead of blood delhi palace saved my dinner party! i was getting over a nasty 24-hour bug and was panicked about how on earth i was going to be able to pull off a vegetarian duel birthday dinner party for my scorpio-signed non-meat eating folks my boyfriend suggested ordering a bunch of food for everyone i was non-too-thrilled by this suggestion but felt i had nothing better to offer cooking cleaning and preparing for the party would have surely put me over the edge so i went along with itthe responsibility of ordering for everyone sort of put me in a state of quiet anxiety but i knew i needed to bite the bullet  ordering for 13 people i got the following:apps3 vegetable pakora (6/order) apps - too salty over done wouldnt order again5 samosa (2 large per order) apps - we split them in 2 so there would be 20 they were gone in minutes  so delicious and really reasonable at $249/orderdinner1 vegetable korma - excellent should have ordered 2 of them2 daal maharani - excellent and there was nothing left2 bengan bharta - too salty wouldnt order this again hardly touched2 palak paneer - excellent a true hit1 malai kofta - delicate and deliciousoh how could i forget we ordered lots of garlic naan and a platter of basmati rice  the apps came with mint chutney and tamarind chutney and i ordered raita (cool whipped yogurt) to drizzle over the spicy prepsdinner was around $170 it was entirely worth it  no stress no mess and everyone was thanking us for the indian treats plus we had indian food for dinner the next night!what i gleaned from this experience was i could have definitely ordered less food  there was tons of left overs  i would say that one dinner dish safely satisfies 2 guests  favorites were: palak paneer vegetable korma daal maharani garlic naan samosasone last thing this place has the best indian buffet in town if youre into that sort of thing (wink) i may be biased as this is the first indian restaurant ive ever eaten at but i love it my sister and i have date night here about once a month we look forward to gorging on their delicious naan chicken tikka masala palak paneer and rice those dishes are so good wonderfully flavored and full of awesome i love spinach my sister hates it once i got her to try the palak panner she was hooked! now we fight over who gets the last piece of cheese their chicken tikka is the best ive had the chicken is flavorful and the sauce has a creamy and silky texture perfect to dip your naan in weve also had their butter chicken and chicken curry both were excellent they also offer traditional indian dinners (vegetarian and meat) which have a little bit of everything theyre great for introducing indian food to first timers oh and the mango lassi is delicious! since everything is a la carte it can get pricey but the portions are generous i have yet to try their lunch buffetit has a really nice atmosphere and is never overly crowded so you can have a nice conversation the decor is also lovely the staff is very friendly and helpful they have a small market attached full of spices medicines bangles hena kits and other various food itemsreally great restaurant! i was checking the reviews when i saw the yelp coupon and bought it! we ordered: samosas chicken tikka masala ($1099) palak paneer ($899-spinach and cottage cheese) and goat masala (1199?) im not a frequenter of indian cuisine establishments so i cant really compare it to others but the chicken tikka masala was amazing! palak paneer was also great the goat masala was good not gamey at all! they definitely dont clean the bones away very well so be careful not to chip a toothserver was not overly friendly but good enough between him and the 2 bussers who were prompt to refill our waters from ordering a little too high on the spicy scale :)i need to come back for the lunch buffet for $899 sometime! big bunch of family over so we created our own buffet!  shrimp biryani veggie biryani tandoori shrimp and tandoori chicken chicken tikka masala palak paneer samosas raita and lots of naan (plain cheese and garlic)  everyone loved the chickenwhich i dont eat but others said it was good  i loved both biryanis and the paneer with raita over it  i also loved the naan dipped in masala sauce! so glad its close to home! based on the reviews went here for lunch they had buffet with one meat and 3-4 vegetarian dishes for around $10 tried palak paneer but the paneer(cheese) itself  was missing the dish it was like having chicken curry without chicken long story short the food lacked the taste that you find in good indian cuisine all i have to say is - im a punjabi and i endorse this messageportfolio - chicken tikka masala chana masala palak paneer garnished with courteous service a gem in the middle of this desert,3.8,10
Tamba Indian Cuisine & Lounge,a little secret hidden in the hawaiian marketplace tamba was a surprising find and the quality was outstandingi was with a party of 5 and we all got something different and spent the evening swapping tastes of each others dishes i myself had palak paneer and yellow rice the paneer was excellent and generous portions of tofu the rice was nearly perfect but just a tad undercooked/dry but worked well as a mix with the paneer wrapped up in fresh nanthe dishes and the restaurant are well presented with authentic palettes and decor the music was subtle an unobtrusive and the waiter was superbwhile this restaurant is in vegas the prices were a little high than id normally expect but are a pretty good deal considering the location good deals can be had if you check the normal coupon books there are specific ones for tamba that could have saved us a bitwith all that said while the food was excellent the staff was superb and the atmosphere was inviting the restrooms were atrocious i was pretty shocked considering the dining experience to find the bathrooms somewhat trashed and unkept which worried me a littleoverall i still give tamba 4/5 but please folks take care of those frightening bathrooms and youd easily be a 5 this review is solely for the lunch buffet:tamba offers perhaps the best indian lunch buffet in town  unlike most indian restaurants in vegas the cooks at tamba dont focus on a bland tourist palate  and as a result they dont produce spice-less offeringswhat the buffet does offer is an amazing array of vegetarian options--tasty spicy and delicious options--chana masala (chick pea masala) palak paneer and various other vegetable-based deliciousness  but the buffet isnt solely for the vegetable lover  the tamba buffet also carries several chicken dishes in well-crafted sauces  if youve eaten at a few vegas indian buffets youll know that tasty and spicy foods are rare  so if youre near the south side of the strip for lunch you cant do much betteras for the dinner or regular dishes (not in buffet form) i havent tried them but several india-born friends have told me that tamba is the best indian restaurant in town my absolute favorite indian restaurant in vegas  hands down  try the tandoori fish  palak paneer and butter chicken  to die for!,4.333333333333333,3
Udupi Indian Veg & Vegan Cuisine,i thought this place would be shut down by the health department by now!  this used to be my favorite indian restaurant (no matter if its vegetarian) until it had a string of health inspections and violations that threatened to close its doors almost every two months last year  seriously i thought it was hanging by a fingernail a few months ago but judging from the recent dated reviews its still open  i dont know if i should celebrate or be a little worried  i try to check restaurants stats by using maricopagovs link and i couldnt get myself to dine there a few weeks ago as udupi still does not have a good report but then again most of the indian places i like didnt either (only royal taj consistently gets golds)i do love the dosas here simply the best resto for dosa!  the gobi manchurian is quite a dish!  love the app sampler  their palak paneer is the best ive had in the valley!  this could easily be my favorite of all indian venues but the owners/cooks seriously need to heed health inspection reports (and so do the customers!!)  come on now how hard is it to take the time to wash your hands before you continue preparing food after you come in from dumping trash in the garbage bin?  we consumers can help keep these restaurants efficient and their kitchens clean which translates to our digestive systems uncompromised by voting with our wallets!!as soon as udupi gets a great health report i will be back to enjoy its menu before i go into details about todays experience at udupi i want to attest that the food i had tasted wonderful  my friend and i agreed to meet for lunch  i was the first to arrive by at least ten minutes  this gave me ample time to survey the buffet and ask the host questions concerning my food allergies  however before i started with the allergy questions i inquired if the buffet came with dosa  the host said yes  (we would later find out during check out that buffet dosa cost an additional $4  so the correct answer would be no)  after all of my questions had been answered i concluded that only the white basmati rice bread (plain paratha and iddly) four of six chutneys homemade papadum and dessert [homemade cottage cheese balls (think non-fried gulab jamun) soaked in sweetened coconut milk sprinkled with crushed pistachios and other spices] were allergen-free  im not much of a chips and dips person (unless spinach artichoke garlic and cheese and a few whole wheat crostini are involved) so my prospects concerning the buffet looked pretty grim  while attempting to place a phone call and i wondering out loud if i should have my friend meet me elsewhere i spied a dish containing one dosa sitting on my table  the host overheard my asking my friend if he was going to have the buffet (yes that was his intention) and i then asked the host that rather i have my friend meet me elsewhere which meant that the dosa would have to be thrown away could he have the buffet and dosa and i could order something off the menu?  yes was the answer  before i even looked at the menu i ordered the palak paneer with rice  he quickly turned in my order and i proceeded to take a couple of bites of the now-cooled dosa  the host suddenly did a 180 and returned to my table to tell me that i couldnt share my friends buffet or else he would have to charge me for another buffet  i said that i was only having the cold dosa which he would have to throw away had i decided to leave and he said that it was against restaurant policy for two people to share the buffet  i said i understood that i wasnt intending to share my friends buffet entree but that i was only having the cold dosa which my friend would probably prefer to be hot and fresh  (i made a mental note not to come back here anymore or at least not to come back anytime soon  i also thought i should have gone with the idea of going somewhere else)friend finally arrived grabbed some buffet items and sat down to eat  it took about 20 minutes for my palak paneer (spinach homemade cottage cheese cubes onions spices and coconut curry) entree to arrive but the wait was definitely worth it- the spinach leaves had a beautiful dark green color to it and werent at all mushy the cubes of cheese were meaty on the outside and creamy on the inside and the onions cubed chilies and spinach stems and other spices perfected the masterpiece  i can eat this over rice or stuff it into dosa or pita bread and be blissful!its good to know that the food served here is delectable  it must be said however that other than the news that the venue has been under new management for over a year now i would not have been able to surmise anything had changed at all- invariant furniture and decor; consistent and scrumptious food (same cooks in place?); and familiar faces among the staff (even the same hosts manning the door and register)  i wish the new management sustained success okay so i love this place too   indian food is possibly my favorite cuisine   i was in tempe for a few days and my vegetarian self always struggles out on the highway seeking the best experiences i can have and always fearful of going hungry   well at 9:10pm friday night i accidented upon this place in a goofy strip mall next to a motel 8 and nervously asked if it was too late to dine since they were closing at 10pm  the owner was very welcoming and seated us promptly   the place was a bland sun-drenched pink walled space with a buffet at the back wall   i didnt have much hope at all   but when our palak paneer and our bharwan baigan curry showed up the salivating began    perfectly prepared the eggplant was absolutely delectable  the spinach and cheese also very delicious   i couldnt beleive it this was a definite rival to my fave indian kitchen back home   i loved it     we had some leftovers but no rice to go with it so the owner gave us free rice so we could have our curries for breakfast in the am   -  a definite must if you like true indian vegetarian food    tempe has its indian going on this is by and far my favorite indian restaurant in the phoenix metropolitan area! they have the most delicious palak paneer and i love their peas paratha! i have never had a bad experience here and routinely order their food for take-out the staff is polite and attentive and the prices are reasonable i was overall happy with the food we ordered the appetizer platter to try various things and the only thing i didnt like was a hard round patty thing that was really dry the variety of dips were great i had the malai kofta (veggie & cheese balls deep fried in a yummy yellow sauce) and it was awesome hubby had palak paneer (cheese & spinach sauce) and i found it bland but he said it was ok paratha stuffed with garlic was ok the garlic was bitter ive found garlic is bitter when its gone too old so i assume thats what happened service was weird place was empty when we got there and the first person to the table laughed when i said wed order the appetizers while we look at the menu which is just odd there were about 4 different people coming to the table so i dont know who our actual waiter was but the only person that smiled and seemed friendly was the man who brought the food to the table the rest were quiet and sort of like mannequins that moved nothing was bad though except for maybe the fly that kept landing on thingswhen we left one of the employees (who was missing teeth and looked like a meth head) was begging the host/manager person to stop payment on his paycheck because he didnt use the account anymore he said he owed money in the account so if the check deposited the bank would take the money i thought this in really bad taste i really dont want to know a tasty buffet that serves vegetarian and vegan dishes udupi offers a great variety of curries starches and desserts that will please anyone that doesnt need to have meat at every meal  for me usually i enjoy the veggie dishes at indian restaurants more than the meaty ones anyways so i didnt mind not eating meat for my lunch  we went on a sunday afternoon and found a mix of various northern and southern indian dishes  some buffet items included vadai palak paneer sauteed green beans (sorry forgot the name!) and veggie korma  there was also a cold foods station with salads yogurt and sauces  for breads they offered papadum paratha and they make fresh dosa and bring it to your table  i tried a little bit of each buffet hot item and enjoyed each dish  the dosa was light and crispy with a nice curried potato filling  for desserts they had ras malai carrot halwa and coconut burfi  i enjoyed each dessert especially the ras malai which is a sweetened creamy paneer  it was my first time trying it and it was delicious  they also had a thermos with cardamom-infused chai tea with a sign saying it could be made vegan if requested  the price is expensive considering that this is only a vegetarian/vegan buffet (about 11 to 12 dollars per person for the weekend buffet sodas and iced tea extra) but there is a lot of variety to try to make up for it  service was cheerful and friendly and we got a card for 10% off our next visit after paying for our check  maybe we will check out the less expensive weekday buffet to see how the non-weekend buffet measures up! after settling for one or two vegetarian options on menus for years its pretty overwhelming to select something from udupi pages and pages of meat-free amazingness! my dinner companion and i ordered the palak paneer and dhal curries and both were superb i cant wait to go back and try more i love this place! ive tried several different things here but my favorites are the gobi manchurian and the palak paneer its all vegetarian which was awesome when i was a vegetarian but its just as good now even when im not one portions are pretty big so expect to have leftovers or split something i still have yet to make it to the lunch buffet  but ill make it one day sometimes they run a groupon which ive bought before but the prices are pretty cheap without it i wish they delivered there are some good things here to eat  the gobi manchurian is off the hook  the palak paneer is really good  however there are some serious health code issues going on with this place  things are old were cold when i get them and were buffet items from earlier in the day  and there are cockroaches  i had one in my food  unfortunately it was in the last thing i atebarf the vegetables in my curry were obviously frozen from a bag  things taste microwavedservice here is kind of crap  i saw another table get their food before us when we had ordered before them and when we got our food things came out with 5 to 7 minutes between  its really awkward when i have to wait to eat and let my food get cold because were waiting for everyones foodalthough the food is good i wont be coming back here  i am afraid of getting food poisoning and the roach left me thinking about what other nasty thing i could have eaten during my meal,3.6666666666666665,9
New India Bazaar,= = = = = =  this review is for the daily lunch buffet!  = = = = = =new india cuisine is a dining room that lives in the back of the market here at new indian bazaar  i stopped in to try the lunch buffet (of course!) which consisted of 22 food items plus condimentsthe food choices here was about what you expect an an indian buffet but a couple of things were remarkable  although most of these places offer chicken tikki masala & tandoori chicken these two dishes were just amazingly good here!  it might have been my favorite tandoori chicken ever anywhere; so moist juicy & full of flavor!  yum!  the chicken keema (chickenburger with peas & onions) & the mango custard were a little special toosome of the other dishes on the serving line this time were onion pakora (onion rings plus) squash curry palak paneer (spinach with very mild squares of homemade cheese) & chilly bodi (cauliflower with green peppers)the service was friendly & the price low for an indian buffet especially on a saturday at $799i didnt especially care for the dining room but i think the positives here still earn this one a high 3 stars & the awesome tandoori chicken will probably bring me back     :-) last night was our first time at new india i came in with four other friends one of us is gluten-intolerant and the rest are vegetarians this is a wonderland for anyone with vegetarian tendencies though they also have a meat menu for the carnivoresi had the palak paneer the dinner ($12) comes with rice curried vegetables salad raiti (yogurt) naan and a pickled side and a dessert its enough to have 2-3x leftovers the food is delicious if you love indian food but only can afford the buffet during lunch at most places youll love it here its affordable genuine and ridiculously good im coming back!,4.0,2
Saffron,i dont even know where to start maybe with the stained tablecloth? or maybe with the decorations held up by masking tape? oh i know! how about the fact that we had to wait half an hour for our entrees! this place looks gross inside and out and the food i had was really superlatively awful i love indian food because it is so flavorful and this completely failed to live up to expectations i had the samosas which werent too awful and the palak paneer which literally had almost no flavor at all to add insult to injury everything was cold we didnt get any rice (i guess youre supposed to buy it separately? would have been nice to know) and service took forever which is totally understandable since there was one other table in the entire placethe only reason we went to this place was because we mistakenly bought a groupon that we thought was for the other saffron that is closer to us but if i had known what it was going to be like i would have just kissed the money for the groupon goodbye and not bothered its not fine dining but its good their food tastes like a home cooked indian meal the owner and his wife are very kind everytime i go around 2pm-ish the wife does the cooking and serving so service does take a little while the biggest disappointment for me was the palak paneer- or spinach with paneer cheese it was the worst thing i have had there i like the chicken with the tomato cream sauce and rice that was my favorite,2.0,2
Kabab Palace,this place is great! we thought that we were going back to the afghan restaurant but found out that it had changed to an indian restaurant once we were already through the door we decided to give it a try the food was amazing! really really good northern and southern indian food we ordered the palak paneer the chole and the okra (forget the name) each dish was delicious! the palak paneer is normally a pretty bland dish but it was surprisingly (and deliciously) spicy! the okra had a nice spice as well i couldnt stop eating it! we also ordered one of the chaat appetizers it was unlike anything that ive had before which is always a great treat because ive had a lot of indian food i have only just recently discovered chaat dishes and ive never seen them in a sit down restaurant neat!we were really happy that the curries came with plentiful rice and naan bread (you usually have to order bread separately) the atmosphere of the restaurant is really pleasant and a little up-scale the bathrooms are ehhh but not awful the owner came over afterwards to see how we liked the meal which is always a nice touch the server was a little new at the job and wasnt able to answer our questions fully however she looked like she had just started and needed more time to learn the ropesoverall a really wonderful surprise! one of the best indian restaurants in phoenix,4.0,1
Nandini Indian Cuisine,we were really sad to see royal taj close down like seriously i almost went in to a depression :(so when we heard nandinis was open we were super excited to go try! the restaurant looks brighter and spruced up and to our delightful surprise the food was even better than before! four a party of 4 we ordered the:lamb korma (lamb cooked in special house gravy) $1399  chicken tikka masala (boneless chicken pieces grilled in tandoor cooked in a mild creamy tomato gravy) $1199 palak paneer (tender chunks of indian cottage cheese cooked in a spinach sauce) $899 with:garlic naan (white leavened garlic sprinkled bread baked in clay oven) $249lamb naan (white leavened bread stuffed with minced roasted lamb baked in clay oven) $399and ricei put $$ because they offer a cheaper lunch buffet $ which we have yet to try dinner is more in the range of $$  at the end they brought over some complimentary gulab jamun (succulent treats from the north made of special dough fried and served in sugary syrup)! delicious :)i would recommend these three entrée items for sure! if you are a vegetarian the palak paneer is a must - soooo delicious its creamy spinach and the cheese is super fresh tasting they go great together! but the lamb korma has to be the winner - with chichken tikka masala as a close second for something new we tried the lamb naan which was like an indian version of a quesadilla with lamb pieces in between their delicious naan bread cant wait to try more new items on the menu :) this one was great! for any newbies this place is a must! the new owner seemed very friendly and accommodating the restaurant decor is so-so but i havent found indian food this good anywhere else in az were soooooooo happy theyre back!,5.0,1
Mount Everest India's Cuisine,whats up with me? 2 indian buffets in 4 days that must be a first for me i dont think ive been to one for six months prior to this my craving for the indian buffet had not been satiated by my visit to mint and so i was determined to have a good experience today after extensive research on yelp i decided to try mt everest a co-worker of mine agreed to join me (ditching his diet) thanks to the fact that shari s had described the naans here as being billowy we made the long 10 mile trudge to mt everest from the office this buffet is seriously amazing for a little tiny place charging 899 per person it seriously hit every craving and made us happy campers there is an extensive vegetarian selection in the buffet: soft basmati rice with peas palak paneer punjabi kadi malai kofta dhal cauliflower and potato stirfry sambar idly samosas pakoras and a myriad of chutneys yogurt salad and dips i have only good things to say about every single dish on the buffet tasted good and the ingredients were all fresh indian buffets frequently omit primo dishes like paneer (indian cottage cheese cubes) kofta (indian dumplings in gravy) samosas and fresh (not frozen) veggies in their food mt everest did no such thingthey spared no expense and made this buffet experience fantastic my co-worker who eats meat couldnt stop raving about the creamy chicken makhani lamb curry and the samosas (he went pretty crazy with all the chutneys) and yes the garlic naans that came with the buffet (we asked for garlic) were billowy and extremely tasty my only gripe with mt everest is the dessert selection they had sweet ricewhich really is a cop-out dessert but i settled for their fresh fruit selection (oranges and watermelon) i would give these guys a 45 stars (taking off a half star for the dessert) but since i cant on yelp they get a four next time if they serve gulab jamun i will be more than happy to up it to a no-questions asked 5 star reviewits truly heartwarming to see an indian buffet keep its quality consistent even after being open a while mt everest really did warm my heart and brought back some of my lost hope in the indian buffet genre in las vegas thanks to all the yelpers that did a wonderful job describing this place you guys were spot on! the bf and i came in and we were sat down immediately with some ice water and papadams with chutney as we browsed the menuwe decided to get themt everest special ($2199) which comes with: mixed appetizer salad papadam chicken tikka dal makhani palak paneer lamb curry chicken tikka rice naan raita for dessert gulab jamun and chai tea  we did not really get what was on the menu as we didnt get salad or our dessert but kheer rice pudding instead i didnt realize this until looking at the online menu for this review either way- its alot of food but would have been nice to get what we ordered the mix appetizer was some grilled sausage chicken tikka pieces a samosa and little papadam bites it was a very big plate and was super filling the main dishes were decent with the paneer being my favorite my one thing was that the paneer and the dal needed a bit of salt but still good raita was more tangy and watery than most ive had but was good to dip my naan in the kheer was very nice and not too sweetchicken korma ($1299)- entrees come with rice it was decent but was more yellow curry flavor than other kormas ive had we also got some garlic naan ($299) thinking that there might not be enough naan with the mixed plate but if we didnt order this the plain naan would be more than enough the amount of food for two people with that is crazy we had leftovers which i had for two separate and still very sizable lunches we would have been very full and satisfied with just the mixed plate but we had a restaurantcom certificate to use service was okay they started off good with drink refills when they came to drop off food after a while they were doing tasks and seemed to be really into it towards of our meal so we sat there for a while needing things overall the food here isnt my favorite indian but decent it definitely is the most value large portions than any others ive been to would you care to feed a small army?  does your army enjoy delicious indian-spiced foods?   then bring them down to mount everest!i dont know why but my husband and i always order our staples when we go to an indian restaurant and we can be pretty particular about them  things were no different here  our staples are: saag paneer (called palak paneer here) vegetable korma mango lassi and garlic naan  because we had a restaurantcom coupon we were also able to order paneer tiki masala and vegetable samosasnormally at other indian restaurants this would be a ton of food for us which (sadly) we can finish if we are hungry enough (but we are giant pigs)  mount everest takes the cake for largest serving sizes in the valley  we had two boxes of leftovers!  you are definitely getting your moneys worth herenot only are the portions huge but this is some of the best indian food ive had  they have given my beloved mint a run for their money  the paneer tiki masala had great flavor and lots of paneer  plus the paneer was fantastic- it was denser than most paneer and had a very mild flavor  i could be wrong but it seemed like it was made fresh  the vegetable korma was mildly spiced (in a good way) and was loaded with a large variety of fresh vegetables  the saag paneer was a little different than what im used to but i still enjoyed it  it was a little milder had a lot of cream and the spinach was well-blended  all these dishes we ordered medium but they were pretty mild on the spice  i think we could have could have ordered spicier and been okthe free papadums were good and i enjoyed the mint and tamarind sauces  the mango lassi while having a very interesting intense orange color im not used to was very good as well  the vegetable samosas were gigantic but a little bit on the greasy side  the garlic naan had every inch covered in garlic (hooray!) but seemed a little uncooked in the middle  the service was very friendly but a little slow at times especially when the place began to fill up  the building may be a little iffy on the outside (what is that an old pizza hut?) it was very nice on the inside and very clean  plus they play bollywood movies!oh and did i mention that they gave us an extra giant order of rice for all our leftovers?  for free?overall this is a great place to enjoy some delicious indian food  just be prepared to take some home! being indian and all i can cook indian food fairly well but i seek out indian restaurant for the beautiful diversity of regional specialties that i just dont know how to cook or do not have the equipment to cook (eg tandoor oven) in the 3 years that i lived here i have yet to find an indian restaurant that blows me away but mt everest is one of the better ones came here on a saturday night around 7:00 pm not the best looking place from the outside but still hopeful this was a diamond in the rough the parking lot was full however surprisingly there were only two other tables filled however towards the end of our meal the restaurant filled out  my husband and i got there before the other couple joining us (it is one of their favorite restaurants)  the staff immediately greeted and seated us  we had a few moments to look arounddecor is a bit dated with the dark green upholstery but well kept  we ordered a bottle of wine from the limited but reasonably priced popular wines  once the other couple arrived they were immediately recognized as familiar faces by the staff  prior to ordering we were served complimentary papadoms with the tradition mint and tamarind chutneys we ordered tandoori chicken as an appetizer this is a great value given there were atleast 8 pieces  it came out sizzling hot serve on a cast iron skillet  i wanted to love it as its sight and sound captured my senses but it was missing that aromatic smell  that is right it was not aromatic or flavorfulkind of bland for tandoori but nothing offensive and definitely well prepared  still worth getting because it comes out fresh and sizzling just spritz with lemon and sprinkle  salt it is more than fine  shortly after our main dishes came out--palak paneer chicken tikka rogan josh garlic naan and a side kachumber salad  first off the portions were plentiful and more than enough to feed four hearty adult appetites and two for lunch the next day  the palak to the palak paneer makes that dish silky creamy and very comforting but could use a bit more spice although it was ordered at a level 6 on spice scale (1 to 10)  the chicken tikka was tasty and familiar in the sweet tomatoey stylei prefer it slightly less sweet but again well made and worth trying  the rogan joshs flavor was complexly layers and my favorite dish; it almost like my moms!  however we ordered it at a level 10 spiciness but it was much milder than expected  although i dont eat bread according to my fellow dinners the garlic naan was fresh warm and soft   the kachumber salad was standard  throughout our meal  the manager/owner(?) kept checking to make sure we were satisfied and of course asking if we wanted more wine once we finished the bottle we order  he gave us generously filled glasses for $5 and we had a friendly conversation  overall the food was prepared with quality ingredients and with care but lacked a bit of seasoning  i havent returned to many indian restaurants in vegas but i am sure to return to mt everest because the food is good well priced and the manager and staff is friendly a special combination lacking in most indian restaurants my favorite indian restaurant (gaylord) is now out of business and other indian restaurants ive been to have been mediocre which is why im so glad i gave mount everest a try eventhough the place was kind of creepy  the quality of the food is comparable to gaylords but you get more food and pay a lot less  the people that work here are very nice and friendly  they have bollywood videos on at all timesthey give you a basket of papadum with mint and tamarind sauces  we started of with samosa (theyre like potato-filled empanadas with ginger and spices) and aloo tikki (fried patties of mashed potatoes in chick pea batter)mango lasi:creamy mango shake 5/5veggie samosa:you get two pieces for $4  the crust was the right thickness and wasnt too doughy  you can definitely taste the spices  i had to use the tamarind sauce to tone down the heat a bit very filling 4/5aloo tikki:you get 2 patties for $4 crispy deep-fried mashed potatoes  very filling as well  great flavor 5/5palak paneer:i was looking for the cheese on top since thats what im used to  4/5garlic naan:i love this stuff  we had 2 orders hot garlicky and buttery bread to scoop/dip saucy dishes with 5/5chicken tikka masala:my favorite indian dish  we ordered mild but it was still quite spicybut it burned so good 5/5kulfi:a mild cheesy ice cream and you can see pistachio bits 4/5gulab jamun:my favorite indian dessert theyre like hot cheese dougnuts in simple syrup 5/5i honestly wasnt expecting the food to be that good  this is my new favorite in vegas!  they also have a lunch buffet from 11am-3pm for $10-11  id come back here for that! my craving for indian food comes once in a blue moon and finally that blue moon was shining so bright!nah just kidding but as far as i can remember the last times weve had indian food was the cmyes at namaste and mint walking to india masala after helping set up for the first nerdy dancing and most recently apps at mantra masala which was okaythis called for a visit that was long overdue so we scrolled down the list and picked the highest rated place in town which was mt everest at $1099 for a lunch buffet of a pretty good spread that would please just about any palate:basmati and sweet rice jhukuni aloo vegetable samosas punjabi kadi palak paneer mattar paneer gajar halwa chicken curry goat curry chili chicken chicken makhani tandoori chicken salad bar assorted chutneys naan and rice pudding i tried every offering once then went back for seconds and thirds of my favorites the sweet rice goat curry punjabi kadi and both paneer dishes honestly one of the best lunch deals in townservice was great water glasses and our naan basket was replenished quickly and you can watch and listen to some bollywood action while enjoying your meal looking forward to returning and this time no need to wait for that blue moon!aloha!!!shaka meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uu  45yelp 365 challenge 2014-(38/365) bomb bites and bollywood beats of all the indian places in vegas this is a frequent stop for me! i am pretty stuffed and satisfied everytime after dining here  the restaurant seems like a family owned business and the customer service is wonderful!! they are super nice friendly and seem easy to get their attention if you need anything theres also a tv playing in the corner with current indian movies with plenty of bollywood dancing and hip current indian music  the usual dishes we order are:  - appetizers: vegetable pakora and samosas thinly spiced cracker (dont know the name of it - sorry) - main dishes : tandoori chicken palak paneer chicken korma chicken makhani lamb curry (rogan josh) - sides: garlic naan and ricethe appetizers are very tasty and a good size that come with a mint jutney sauce and a spicier sauce  all the main dishes are very good also  warning though if you ask for spicy these dishes can definately make you sweat like a banshsee!! just ask my bf!! i like them milder and ask for mild or a level 3 and they are delish  maybe 5 or higher will be too spicy and possibly not enjoyable but up to ones palate  the tandoori chicken comes out on a sizzling plate and the chicken is so tender and tasty always a safe bet  the chicken makhani (butter chicken) is my absolute favorite! the korma and curry are pretty rich in spices and have very distinct flavors to the dishes  i think the palak paneer is alright but reminds me more of creamed spinach - so maybe a pass  this place is small and cozy but usually hopping with customers  the food may come out a bit slower when they are busy but its worth the wait  always happy with the food and service here that makes me keep coming back for my indian food fix!!  i really need to come for the lunch buffet which looks like a great deal for the same food,4.142857142857143,7
Taza Indian Kitchen,i had lunch at taza recently and while i claim no knowledge of indian food i enjoyed it it was just under $12 per person if i remember correctly which seems average and there was a pretty large selection the butter chicken and tandoori chicken were especially delicious -- although for the latter they had two batches while i was there and the first was a little dry very very flavorful thoughi want to say there were at least 8 hot dishes (like palak paneer spicy garbanzo beans goat curry samosas pakora etc) soup a chutney section a salad and desserts (cream puffs and cake-ish things too along with other things i do not know the names of) and of course they bring you a basket of warm yummy naan again as someone who knows nothing about indian food id go again everything tasted good to me,4.0,1
New India Cuisine,i still love woodlands the best but a lunchtime craving for indian food paid off when we went to new india! i got the palak paneer combo- the portions were great as was the food the spicy chutney they served was amazing the gobi was even better- spicy and not overloaded with sauce the prices were decent and the service was great- im assuming it was the owners that were working i really want to go back and try the buffet too! = = = = = =  daily lunch buffet!  = = = = = =as we see in some of the mediterranean businesses this starts out as a smallish grocery store but also has a restaurant area to go with it  i stopped in today to try the lunch buffet (of course!) which consisted of 22 food items plus condiments served up in a dining room in the back with tables & chairs but no boothsthe food choices here was about what you expect an an indian buffet but a couple of things were remarkable  although most of these places offer chicken tikki masala & tandoori chicken these two dishes here were just amazingly good!  it might have been my favorite tandoori chicken ever anywhere; so moist juicy & full of flavor!  yum!  the chicken keema (chickenburger with peas & onions) & the mango custard were a little special toosome of the other dishes on the serving line today were onion pakora (onion rings plus) squash curry palak paneer (spinach with very mild squares of homemade cheese) & chilly bodi (cauliflower with green peppers)the service was friendly & the price low for an indian buffet especially on saturday at $799i didnt especially care for the dining room but i think the positives here still earn this one a high 3 stars & the awesome tandoori chicken will probably bring this one a return visit!     :-) chatt tea and pizza three of the surprised i found on my last trip most buffets have the usual suspects garnished with rice naan and some condiments but to have a chatt available?  chai tea (included) and even pizza (yes indian style veggie pizza and its good)this is why i am so in love with this place 1 great flavor you can beat the unmuted flavors that sing in your mouth 2 variety there is more to indian the palak paneer and tandori chicken and pakora 3 value great price for a wide range of options next time you are in take a look at the left end of the buffet first and see if you can find a chaat,4.0,3
Sai India Curry,crreeepy hollow! we chose the buffet bad decision real bad1 the open sign was not on and we werent sure if the place was open2 the place is unclean let alone food on the carpets dont get me started on the restrooms!3 the buffet cost us about $9 each oily aloo subzi soggy eggplant and raw and bland tasting palak paneer dal waswell an awful tasting puddle dessert was a taffy textured gulab jamun that was a first4 why there were two empty buffet bowls is still a mystery even if we paid the full price just when you are wondering the owner will then offer you special house cooked curry for free5 if you havent had enough the new owner will show off the yelp certificate to each customer while you are eating whether you like it or not6 you will also hear a lot of we have no decor here but we serve clean and tasty food made from scratch mmmmnyah the first part is true scratchyeah sure the food does taste like wall particles :) and clean well i think its been a while since the health authorities took a look after all the open signs off7 are we done yet? nomore lectures about how the food is half price as compared to any other indian restaurant in vegasthe only nice thing was naans but not worth your money better off putting them in slots!,1.0,1
India Masala,the food here is amazing we went with some friends that were visiting from out of town and they loved it so much that we went twice in 3 daysthe best thing about this place is that the food is fresh and tasty and very close to homemade foodthe masala dosa is crisp and yummy(infact we had many people looking curiously at what this food was) the veg dishes including palak paneer come with a naan and rice our friends tried the tandoori combo which was very good as well as the fish curry and goa chickenthe ambience is ok but the food is really good vegetable samosas with a delicious and  refreshing spicy cilantro sauce to complement both the samosa and the tamarind sauce that comes with it too! the palak paneer is so delicious and not too over spiced or under seasoned and its accompanied with a large naan bread that has been warmed on the grill along side a bed of  soft-fluffy fragrant jasmine ricemy mouth is watering already!this place is indeed a hidden gem in the culinary world of the strip its in the riviera casinos food court! who would of known? i just happened to had walked inside with hunger and the scent of indian home cookery led me to this fabulous place!if you are hungry (the servings are enough for 2 to share) and are on a budget but not in a palate budget then come over for some darn delicious food! plus the staff was so calm patient and helpful!i will come here again on my next trip to vegas! bad food:( we ordered a plain dosa and veggie combo - the plain dosa was hot came with sambhar and chutneys - sambhar had no salt and was waterychutneys were watery and cold i think made few days ago veggie combo - had rice naan chole palak paneer curd and dal the palak paneer hardly had any paneer - and was firm chole dal - salt less curd - was thin and sour i think made up few days ago not worth the money just a temporary way to kill hunger review by an indian!,3.3333333333333335,3
Copper Kettle,i have had take out twice recently the first time i placed my oder it was never put into the computer and the girl who took my oder went home they were friendly apologetic and quick to prepare our food it was tasty but not the best ive had the paneer tikka masala was what  we ordered the second time we ordered we got the palak paneer lamb korma and the paneer tikka masala this time around the food was mainly oil!!! the lamb korma looked like oil with lamb in it im not exaggerating the palak paneer was fairly tasteless and oily as well the tikka masala was oily but tasty still  after tonight i will not be returning i doubt their food is always  this oily but i would rather not risk it happening again the amount of oil was almost comical it was so much,2.0,1
Sutra Fine Indian Cuisine,i must say i am a picky about my indian food  when this place came to goodyear i was stoked  i have been driving over to bell road to satisfy cravings for indian and that was for mediocre satisfaction  im always a bit worried to fall in love with a restaurant especially in this area as most are gone within two yearsbut i did  i have been to sutra seven times now and every single time i think god i hope this place makes it  this restaurant has climbed to my top three favorite indian restaurants  the food is nothing short of amazing  each time a bit different but always very good  the buffet is my favorite b/c i like to try all of the flavors  they have five vegetarian entrees and three or four meat dishes  there is nothing on the buffet that i wouldnt eat again  the tikka masala sauce is rich and flavorful and is spiced just right  the palak paneer (they call it something else) is also wonderful  the service has improved since opening and the son is very professional and is johnny on the spot  my drink never went below 1/3 full and i can get in and out in 30 minutes if i need to   its the father who cooks and i think the recipes he has brought to this restaurant are truly unique  if you love indian food or even if you dont please check this gem out   and in response to anothers comment on seatingits a nice modern place well decorated and there is plenty of seating even at noon sharp  when they first opened they were slammed but things have settled down to normal business now  they also have a full bar with some very interesting wine selections  i take everyone i know there just so they can experience truly excellent indian food,5.0,1
Copper Kettle-Salads Balti & Taandoori Grill,situated right beside the awesome cornish pasty co at first glance this place comes across as a curio shop there are show windows decorated with islamic art pieces and carpets this restaurant scores points on the ambiance unlike other dingy south asian places that ive been to this one has a sealed-out kitchen to keep their customers from a smelly experience since the menu is predominantly pakistani and mughlai it is best for vegetarians to skip this place unless of course they are happy with a couple of paneer dishes indian breads and appetizers it is also useful to be aware of the slow cooking that goes into mughlai food that makes it flavourful in a different way people who visit this place expecting a mish-mash of spicy curries might be disappointed when we went there we found that a young fellow was managing the show we went ahead with the lassi palak paneer naan sindhi chicken biryani and the lamb curry satisfied with the first three courses we wanted to round up our dinner with phirni the young fellow (presumably the owners son) wanted to pass off kheer as phirni but since we knew the difference we cancelled the order overall it was a good experience and well be going back for more,4.0,1
Delhi Palace Cuisine of India,ive been eating at delhi palace for years and  it is pretty decent north indian food nothing to blow your doors off but good enough the lunch time buffet can be hit or miss but when it is on it is oh so good tandoori chicken tikka masala palak paneer garlic naan and pakoras are some of my favorites they also serve a hot tea and i am not sure what it is called but it goes really well with the spicy foodwhen i am not dining for lunch the mushroom bhajee or seafood tandooris are  my dishes of choice dont fool yourself into thinking the veggie options are going to be good for you most of their dishes are loaded in cream ghee or paneer so diner beware it is easy to pack in over 1000 calories in a sitting make sure to top it off with a flying horse lager this beer is so good i usually order one to go! i love indian food! and ive had a lot of indian food regularly though out my life in many countries delhi palace cuisine serves very good north indian food its as simple as that it is reasonably priced tooi went there for dinner with a few friends of mine after one of them boasted ill take you to the best indian restaurant in phoenix! hes probably rightwe shared the food so had the beef biryani which was very good the chicken tikka masala which was great its a creamy dish as its supposed to be but they didnt over do it as some places do so dont feel guilty about ordering it the tandoori chicken was excellent and im picky about tandoori chicken they have  a decent vegetarian section but i only tried the palak paneer & it was some of the best ive had; even though its not usually my type of dishi didnt like the ice tea though it tasted like it had some special spice or something but serves me right for ordering ice tea at an indian restaurant the garlic nan was good toothe atmosphere is typical for lots of indian restaurants it doesnt feel like a cafeteria or anything like that but its not going to impress anyone or wow your date but its comfortable relaxed unpretentious and true/authentic to the type of restaurant there were a few indian couples around; always a good signthe service was excellent; they didnt interrupt the conversation as ive found happens too often in us restaurants these days but they were always there; prompt ready to serve & respond i didnt feel rushed eitherin a nutshell if you want to experience tasty authentic north indian food and enjoy your meal & company check this place out im definitely coming back i have yet to find a better mix of service and food at any indian food restaurant the place is dark cool and the food is incrediblepalak paneer - good for your vegetarian friendschicken korma - sweet and savory flavors in a creamyyellow saucelamb boti kabab - the onions will melt in your mouthchicken tikka masala - tomato base with a little kickgarlic naan i could go on and onhave the papadum and ask for the mango chutney as your appetizer if you are so inclined the veggie samosas are delicious with some of the tamarind sauce drizzled on top have some indian tea to drink but save room for the kheer for dessertthey are also good for to-go orders and its usually ready in minutes! i spend allot of time at the tempe improv so i go to the delhi palace for the lunch buffet which is located on the south side of the building across the street on university the lunch buffet is open from 11:00 - 2:30 so if you like authentic northern indian cuisine this is the real deal for $895 and the best part is you dont have to whip out the sun brand tandoori powder and make it yourselfi normally do not like buffet food that has been sitting under a heat lamp for any length of time but if you arrive early at 11:00 when they first open there is a good chance your buffet food experience will be a good one i believe the food on the lunch buffet is not spicy on purpose to appeal to the masses which would make since i personally prefer my indian food spicy with some burn and im sure if you order something off the regular menu they will kick it up a notch for youthe delhi palace is home of the masala they have chicken tikka masala garam masala chana masala chaat masala tandoori masala and even yogurt masala the only masala missing off the menu is penn masala the worlds first hindi a cappella singing group formed in 1996 by a group of students at the university of pennsylvania deep down i must believe asu is working on their first hindi a cappella singing group but heck thats another storymy personal favorites here are the tandoori chicken chicken korma palak paneer chicken tikka masala and the garlic naan bread if your into indian beers you will like the fact they have taj mahal and flying horse royal lager beer i normally drink the hot chai tearepeat after me can you say green mint chutney the best indian i ever had was this navajo babe whose name translated spreads like butterthe second best indian food that is was here at delhi palacewell not really it was in london but who cares thats like five thousand miles awayif you live in phoenix or visit here often and you like indian (dots not feathers) youll want to go here heres why the place is crawling with indians and thats a good sign considering most indian joints are littered with white people and everyone knows white people cant tell the difference between a good curry and cold-boiled mulesecondly all the caucasians flock to applebees or olive garden on a typical weekend night evidence of which is a line of people standing outside waiting for hours to be seated i dont like to wait i also dont like making reservationsthats where delhi palace excels in my book i never have to wait on a weekend night since the only people eating there are indians and me the palak paneer is great lamb vindaloo superb tandoori oven cooked foods arent dry and overcooked they also make a good mango lassii like this place even that singy-songy shit they call indian music blaring from the sound system which typically makes me irritable halfway through the meal for some reason i like their music but its still weird you will probably have a hard time finding this place but it is well worth turning on the gpsthis little restaurant is one of many interesting-looking finds in the strip mall and the first time i met my friends there we all got hopelessly lost looking for it its a quaint little place with low-lighting and friendly waiters the food is great and pretty reasonably-priced the first time i went here we tried their combination platters (we were all on seperate checks) and they were both 1) delicious and 2) well worth the price its definitely a nice option for someone who likes to try a bunch of things but maybe is with people who arent used to family style!the second time i was with my family so we got a bunch of disheswe tried the palak paneer (pretty good) lamb biryani (excellent) saag chicken (excellent) chicken mushroom (good) roti (okay) garlic naan (excellent) and poori (excellent)they brought us some complimentary papadum and some fritters (didnt know what these were) for dinner which is always good and very nice of them!definitely try their curries and lamb biryani (by far my favorite) which came with its own little side dish of raita to help take down the spice we kept things at medium level but you can customize from mild-hot depending on your tempermentthe palak paneer was my least favorite but that could have been because i ordered it mild (to mix it up a bit) and it didnt pop in flavor as well as the othersalso my sister and i loved the poori which was a deep-fried wheat bread it tasted like fry bread and was excellent for soaking up sauces service was very attentive and it never took long for a chai or water refillall in all great service and food and i will be back!,4.0,6
Madras Ananda Bhavan,someone pinch me i think i may be dreamingdelicious vegetarian indian food at a decent price only a quarter mile away from my house???i cant believe this place has been around for a few months and i never noticed it! almost perfect a 45 star rating which i will round up because i think it may be the best indian food in the phoenix areathe atmosphere is nothing special clean and simple service was good attentive and informative owner came and talked with us during our meal to welcome us to his restaurantwe had the palak paneer one of the crepe things (forgot what its called) filled with potatoes and cheese and garlic naaneverything was delicious and bursting with flavor! even my carnivore husband was smitten our eyes were practically rolling to the backs of our heads my only very minor complaints serving size of the naan could be a little bigger they only had one combination dinner but it didnt have a curry in the choices and being the alcoholic vegetarian i am i really wish they had a liquor license so i could wash down all this delicious food with a taj mahal otherwise excellent i dont know what the bad reviewers were thinkingcant wait to try their lunch buffet!,5.0,1
Curry Corner,i visited this place last night with a mate after otherwise unsuccessfully attempting to eat other places i am glad considering this place is greatwe shared a vegetarian thali and samosas it came with yogurt gobi aloo masoor dal palak paneer chana masala onion rice in the centre and naan on the side we asked for extra naan their naan was quite fluffy and thick compared to other places that i have eaten from or especially when compared to grocery market purchased naan all of it was very flavourful i was really impressed with the spices on the chick peas especially their palak paneer was a very smooth combination of the paneer and spinach flavours the gobi aloos identity eluded me at first because i had trouble figuring out that the cauliflower on top was upside down the spices did not overpower the buttery nature of the cauliflower and were well accented with potato neither of us are onion fans and both of us prefer our yoghurt sweet so we took no liking to those small sides although they were obviously less important than the curries the masoor dal had an appealing milkiness to it their samosas were extremely good with no lack in filling there was nothing above mild spiciness on our plate which was of no consequence to either of us as everything was hugely savoryas far as the eating environment inside the place is quite small and it seems to be in an otherwise relatively suspicious lot i found it cozy they do not wait on you the menu is right above the order window they do bring out your food to you so there is no need to pick it up they will do take out the staff are all very friendly you serve yourself water from a small stand with cups and pitchers the minimal decorations are pretty and not overbearing although most of curry corners atmosphere seems to come from its customers keeping the place busyi ordered mango lassi on the way out it is thicker than most i have had and instead of being blended with ice it has ice cubes in it to chill it but it was still delicious it also lasted overnight in the fridge and still tasted good the next day i went here last week with a large group (6 people) we ordered 5 dishes including two orders of chicken tikka masala goat curry chicken achari and palak paneer overall we all (including one friend who is indian) thought it was not the best indian food we have hadthe tikka masala was alright but wasnt as rich or flavorful as other tikka masalas i have had i did not care for the chicken achari but i have not had that before so it may just not be something i like in general the palak paneer was alright but again was somewhat bland the goat curry in my opinion was the best thing we had it had a lot of goat flavor (which i like) and was generally tasty the meals all came with either rice or naan but disappointingly the rice was plain white rice (no spices in it like most basmati rices) and the naan was also plain still nice that it was includedwhich brings me to the reason this place is 3 stars and not 2it is soo inexpensive! we each paid six dollars and change for all of that foodmost places would be well over 10$ each so that is worth an extra star all on its own i probably wouldnt come here if you want amazing food but if you want decent food on the cheap this is your place! saw this restaurant on diners drive-ins and dives we had to go the food is excellent spicy and its awesome that the vegetarian section is just as large as the meat section some of my favorites are the palak paneer( freshly chopped spinach greens (palak) cooked with home made paneer (cheese) aloo matar (potatoes sautéed with green peas seasoned with house spices or the vegetarian thali ( 2 vegetable curries and one lentil served with rice naan yogurt and salad)you cant go wrong at this place everything is good if you dont know what to get just take a chance and you wont be disappointed i am a big fan of curry corner they have the best indian/pakistani food in tempe i am a big fan of the chicken tikka masala palak paneer and all of the lamb dishes the biryani rice is also a favorite of mine and of course the naan is also delicious,4.25,4
Indian Paradise,wow  this place was delicious the ambiance felt authentic and our waiter seemed to emanate the heart of india that of which i have often heardmy wife and i were in search of food on a late monday night and we found indian paradise on yelp  we ordered the chicken madras palak paneer and garlic naan and i liked it so much i found myself eating too quickly and wishing i could fit more in my stomach!the naan was among the best ive had and the ingredients in the chicken madras were savory and delicious  my wife who spent months in india said she was immediately harkened backoverall i love indian food and i loved indian paradise  i humbly offer my 5 stars in thanks for their sumptuous meal thanks yelpers for another great restaurant recommendation! the bf and i went last night and really enjoyed our dinner first of all the service was excellent everyone was so kind and attentive ive only been to indian restaurants a handful of times and each of those times was with experienced indian restaurant-goers so i was a little intimidated to be in charge of ordering (my bf has never had indian food before) to be safe i ordered the classics: lamb masala palak paneer (spinach and tofu) and daal makhni (lentils) they were all delicious! the masala was probably our favorite the rice and naan (we got the garlic) were both great with our saucy dishes bf had the himalayan beer (nice a light) and i had the strawberry lassi i love the sweet yogurty tartness of it with the flavorful spiciness of the dishes my boyfriend also tried the red chili pickles that were advertised at the table his order was met with raised eyebrows and an are you sure? by our server what we got were not even remotely close to what we know to be pickles my best guess is maybe some type of bean curd wrapped in chili skin it was more salty than spicy (hence the pickle name?) we asked our server what it was and he said he had no idea and had never had it before ha! they seemed very impressed that my bf ate the pickles ive successfully introduced and converted my boyfriend into an indian food lover well definitely be going back! stopped by for lunch buffet on a saturday based on yelp reviewers and wasnt disappointed  this was really good and tasty indian food  normally im not a big fan of buffets but as this seemed to be the only option at lunch we went for it and werent disappointed  the curry goat palak paneer and paneer tikka masala were all outstanding  the naan was also very good as well as the rice pudding dessert  i didnt think this was overpriced at all for what you got but havent see what you get for hte dinner entreesthe atmosphere is a little cold but htey had music playing and bollywood on the tv  the service was prompt and attentive if a little distancedwe will definately be back indian paradise has a solid lunch buffet at $1195 maybe a little more expensive than usual for a buffet but its in north scottsdale so not completely unexpected either nice interior and even looks like the patio could be a pleasant dining experience when theres nice weather surprising considering that the restaurant is located in a fairly bland out of the way strip mallthe food was very tasty and will certainly sate your desire for indian comparatively it was middle of the road as far as the indian food ive had--not the best but not the worst but if you love indian food like i do you wont be disappointed the lunch buffet has a lot of the standard dishes: chicken tikka masala chicken curry aloo matter palak paneer tandoori chicken etc tikka masala is usually my favorite but theirs was just ok i really liked their chicken curry and aloo matarservice was good; everyone was friendly and attentivealso dont panic when you dont see the naan at the buffet like i did they bring you your own basket :) 7/25/12heard great things about indian paradise from good yelp friends and i thought it was about time i scratched this itch i had for indian cuisine for many weeks  ive passed ip many times before noting it was on hayden rd but never really memorized its location  disregard the directions from navigation android app and follow yelp directions instead  $1095 gets you all-you-can-eat lunch buffet with fresh garlic naan and a glass of water  all other beverages will cost extra  i ordered a mango lassi for $4  buffet selections werent many but i managed to gather a varied plate http://wwwyelpcom/biz_photos/lffye-hh1nkftukv3lugfg?select=d7h3jj4h89ifrify0ia-7w#d7h3jj4h89ifrify0ia-7w that consisted of (clockwise starting with) tandoori chicken palak paneer chicken tikka masala dal tadka (yellow lentils) dal makhni (red lentils) chicken curry  paneer tikka masala (curd cheese in masala sauce) some shredded lettuce for texture (not pictured) mango and tamarind chutneys and finally gulab jamun for dessert  http://wwwyelpcom/biz_photos/lffye-hh1nkftukv3lugfg?select=szjnbzvd9lxjadhg9dmh7g#szjnbzvd9lxjadhg9dmh7g  the mango lassi was gorgeous and better yet it tasted fantastic!  before i had a taste of it a man who was passing by my table on his way out of the door stopped to ask what it was  i guess he liked the look of it as well  i wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who loves mango lassis-- great mango flavor a touch of sweetness and a definite yogurt tang  the naan took a long time to arrive even after i sat down asked for a lassi first had a look at the buffet choices and then proceeded to gather my plate and utensils before lining up to get food  i had to wait another five minutes maybe more before it arrived on my table which then allowed me to take a good photo to upload and then start eating  the naan was warm some parts were crispy some parts were charred and not very flavorful  i couldnt detect a garlic flavor at all  the dals were ok the red saltier than the yellow so i preferred the yellow  i found the palak paneer to be tastier than the paneer tikka masala which was salty yet i found the paneer tikka masalas curd cheese cubes to be more tender therefore more preferable; the cheese cubes in the palak paneer were rubbery  the chicken curry was very appetizing!  loved sopping up the sauce with the naan  perhaps the blandness of the naan was intentional to make it a great companion to the sauces  the tandoori chicken was very very good and perhaps the best ive tried anywhere  great smoke flavor tender and moist-- i wouldnt mind ordering this for an entree  i was already finished with lunch and wanted dessert (gulab jamun rice pudding or watermelon slices) when i spotted the chutneys but i had some naan left so i thought to try them out  the mango chutney looked wonderful and made me wish i had pancakes or crispy waffles to eat it with  before trying it with naan i spooned a little bit into my mouth and found it to be quite salty so it wouldnt do well for a sweet snack unless you like sweet and salty (and i do on occasion but not in mango chutneys)  the tamarind chutney more syrup than chunky chutney really was definitely sweeter  the gulab jamun rounds were tougher than others ive tried; i kept wishing the centers were creamier/silkier  i liked the sweet milk flavor although the syrup wasnt scented with rosewater or saffron  id say pass on these last three and save your calories for a lassi! indian paradise lives up to its name  buttery-fresh naan tasty samosas creamy palak paneer savory chicken tandoori indian salads and so many other options make this a place to be reckoned withseriously they have teleported some of the best indian dishes into phoenix and are ready to square off with the best in the area!  not to mention the service is superb and the building has a classy/ eclectic flavor to it that is hard to find fault with   a bit more coconut milk may help to sweeten the dishes but other than that this is one of the best indian buffets that youll find in phx!,4.0,6
Swagat India,one of my favorite restaurants ive eaten at swagat many times for dinner and lunch ive used their banqueting rooms and ive hired them for cateringits good  really good  with a few caveats - the lunch buffet is generally decent but can be a little hit and miss and a few of the dishes dont survive well under the heat lamps  its a fine enough way to sample a few things but its not the best way to experience indian food because things dont always go together wellalso the default setting for spiciness is often wisconsin spicy particularly with the buffet  however they can and will on request bump up the spiciness (both the heat and otherwise)  having the boti kabob at a spice level of what the chef said was how he would eat it was revelatory  it wasnt blindingly hot but it was deeply savory and complex in a manner that the standard spiciness wasnt  without askingthe standard spiciness can be a smidge bland  their menu is huge and features both north and south indian specialties  the north indian specialties seem to be the best best - the south indian utthapam were good but the iddli were a little dry   ive never had a bad tandoor dish there though and the naan is always excellent service is almost always prompt and attentive  almost too attentive - it always seems like theres a waiter nearby trying to refill my water glass which can be a bit disconcertingwe hired them to cater our wedding and it worked extremely well  it was a big hit with our guests the caterers showed up promptly with a nearly perfect amount of food (we had enough leftovers for a few lunches but we werent swimming in leftover palak paneer) mr singh was very friendly and helpful setup was a breeze and the price was quite reasonable,4.0,1
Flavor of India,the diverse cuisine from the indian subcontinent varies heavily by religion and ethnicity  this place is owned and run by indian muslims so the food is halal (preparation of the food but especially meat is supervised by imams usually this means a step cleaner more humane than just us government inspected but this isnt always true) and they serve beef curries (you wont find this in hindu establishments just like you wont find any pork in here)  the minimum critical mass of south asian customers is in the area thanks to the elite graduate programs of uw-madison to ensure that any indian restaurant in this town has to be at least pretty good and this one is a step up from that       we first dropped in after a long cold day of protesting for worker rights and inexplicably every other restaurant and bar surrounding the capitol was packed with cold weary protesters this one was empty normally a warning sign but we needed to sit down  a very helpful madison police officer (who all seem ridiculously over-educated) recommended the place but i was a bit leery since he was slim and in good shape i usually get my better restaurant recommendations from fat cops) what a pleasant surprise it was dhinchak (wonderful)!      the service was traditionally unhurried the waiter was friendly and polite and unlike a lot of south asian muslim restaurants quite nice to my consort (my disobedient and independent gori wife and chief of staff)  the papadum was hot fresh and crisp served with what seemed to be fresh made chutneys we enjoyed the shrimp curry chana dal (chickpeas) and palak paneer (a distant cousin of american creamed spinach) make sure you order an indian bread with your meal (chapati paratha nan they have a good selection)  a nice basmati rice came with the meal as it should they have a wide selection of vegetarian dishes almost a requirement in madison     the decor is pleasant though uninspired nicer than the usual casual indian joints but not as elegant as more expensive formal indian restaurants  instead of indian music they piped in some annoying muzak-like smooth jazz though at a forgivable background volume surprising for a muslim establishment they have a good selection of wine and beer some local some indian there really arent many places in wisconsin to have wine from india  still i recommend the indian beer instead      i highly recommend this restaurant for you firangi types who want to try indian food but are leery of the reputed heat of south indian (tamil) cuisine the food here is pretty mild  try to eat the food like we do with your right hand it tastes better that way  if youre a desi bhai who likes your food spicy know that i wasnt successful in getting them to make my food nice and hot but in general ive found that northern indian muslim cooking isnt relatively spicy the food here is quite flavorful its not bland its just not hot enough  i did get the waiter to bring me a hot sauce a red chillies paste which did have a little bite to it  finish your meal with a sweet indian desert like galub jamun and masala tea (chai) and dont expect the waiter to come running up with the bill they employ indo-pakistani manners and expect you to relax after eating  theyre pretty attentive though so they will bring you your check when you signal for it,4.0,1
Bawarchi Indian Cuisine,so happy to see another indian place pop up by my house!bawarchi is a no-frills very casual authentic little indian restaurant menu is small but covers most of the basicswe had naan aloo gobi palak paneer and my hubs had a chicken curry the aloo gobi was not my favorite i feel it was mostly onions with very little cauliflower and potatoes it wasnt bad but i have had better at most other indian restaurants the naan was very good so was the palak paneer- very yummy creamy spicy perfect my husband really liked his chicken dish i like that the entrees came with a very generous serving of rice some indian places either make you pay extra for rice or only give you a little biti am disappointed that they recently raised their prices on everything the picture of the menu you see on yelp is not accurate in fact the menu they gave us with our order had the prices crossed out and the raised prices written in classy but the prices are still excellent and a much better value than other local indian restaurants we will be back again and again and again andhra chicken curry and palak paneer r the best finally a great place for curry near me right off the 51! have gone here several times and always impressed i cant waiver from the chicken tikka masala and garlic naan but thank god my gf gets the palak paneer so i can get another awesome flavor change i am yet to see another white person in there when i go so you know its authentic but very clean and professional small inside so we normally get it to go and there has never been a mistake made,4.333333333333333,3
Guru Palace,ive been scouring the valley for a good indian food place and was hoping that guru palace would/could be iti was mistaken its not bad its not good its just kind of  there ill eat there again if someone suggests it but i wont go out of my way to offer it as a place for my friends and i to gatheri was there for the lunch time buffet that was priced at $899  not bad my friend and i were offered naan and i was about to say yes when my friend asked if we would be charged extra for it - we werentthey had chicken tikka masala and chicken korma out the chicken tikka masala was ok but nothing to write home about as was the chicken korma i decided to sample their palak paneer and found it was the best thing they had i also tried their curried pakorabig mistake i like pakora but to combine it in a generic yellow curry sauce was a mistake it just wasnt right it didnt taste right either - neither to myself or my friendas i said the food was ok i was impressed with the decor and the overall cleanliness of the restaurantthe servers were attentive and friendly i swear for every sip of water i took someone was there topping off my glass i like thatill give it a go again and see if they can change my ratingbut ill wait till a friend suggests we go let me preface this by saying im indian and regularly dine at indian restaurants in the valley so if you are someone like me who is interested in reading something other than their buffet was a great deal   then read on  wait while im at it people please dont view indian restaurants like chinese buffets its not about how much you can pile on your plate in fact indian restaurants put out their worst food at buffets because they know the mainstream only care about piling on bad food as long as its cheap for the rest of us who care about quality this review is for you i think you will be impressed with this restaurant if you are indian and you have lived in phoenix you know the phoenix metro lacks quality indian restaurants and you settle on the ones they have that being said this is truly a normal indian restaurant that you are used to from back home (ny chicago la sf boston dallas houston etc)  first the restaurant was clean and open it had vaulted ceilings and plenty of space so it wasnt claustrophobic inside  the ambience was nice yet not stuffy  it was trendy enough but not overly cliche with cheesy gold and brass everywhere  the service was great and timely  the waiters were indians who were american raised so they could speak english most of the indian restaurants in the valley hire hispanics or indians who dont speak english well so that was a plus its location is a plus although technically the restaurant is in mesa think gilbert because the restaurant is basically at the intersection at gilbert and baseline right at the border of gilbert and mesa so its in a nice area that is safe the food: this is a true punjabi owned and operated restaurant so their north indian dishes are the real thing their chicken tikka masala had a nice smooth and consistent texture that was not grainy or overly creamy the meat was succulent and not overcooked  the naan was great and its hard to criticize it but honestly ive had better naan at other restaurants their naan was a little doughy but at least it was large and not some cheap small portion (india palace)  the palak paneer is honestly the best in the city  it wasnt soupy/liquidy in consistency like most of the restaurants  it had flavor and was cooked perfectly  palak paneer is a tough dish to make and most of the phoenix restaurants mess it up by making this cream of spinach soup rather than a proper sabji  their malai kofta was their only real flaw of the evening as the kofta balls were not properly fried nor did they maintain their shape  it was more or less just a curry it was improperly cooked this is the best indian restaurant in the valley  royal taj in tempe is a close second but this is the best 45 stars  5 stars is perfect and ive yet to eat anywhere that makes me dream of it constantly :-)but for indian food on the east valley this is really really good  the staff is friendly and authentic  the lunch buffet is plentiful with your favorites of tikka masala curry pakora palak paneer naan rice etc  all really really good stuff -- and for all-you-can-eat the price is absolutely right!also a good place for dinner with friends  the dinner portions for friend sharing are a bit small (ie if you are in a group of 8 and everyone wants tikka masala -- you may want to order 3)  thats my only complaint though and they dont advertise to be family style anywayits really good and if you live in the east valley and like indian food check it out! after reading all the positive reviews i decided to try out the buffet on sunday afternoon  my husband and i loved everything! the quality was spectacular and everything was super fresh  the buffet offers  deliciously seasoned basmati rice (my favorite in phoenix) chicken curry chicken masala pakora palak paneer goat curry salad fruit tandoori chicken chai tea and regular or garlic naan  there were a few other items but i dont remember what they were called  we ordered the garlic naan and it was to die for it was perfectly grilled and had just the right amount of garlic brushed on it  for only $899 it was one hell of a bargain the atmosphere is also very nice with beautiful paintings and decorative fixtures they also play soothing music  we knew the place was going to be good when half of the patrons were inidan i highly recommend this restaurant to anyone on the east valley we will definitely return on the weekends for the buffet! its been a couple of weeks now since my bf and i went to guru palace but the experience is memorable so its easy to review noweverything we ordered was delicious  i ordered the chicken korma my bf ordered the tandoori mixed grill  we also tried the palak paneer  and naturally ordered some rice and garlic naan to go along with it alli loved the chicken korma  tender pieces of chicken in that heavenly sauce  scooping it up with the garlic naan is the best  the flavor of the mixed grill was scrumptious  the lamb was a little tough thus the reason im only giving guru palace four stars  if i had to go by flavor alone they would absolutely get a five!the palak paneer was just the right mix of creamy spinach and cheese  we ordered everything mild and the staff checked back a couple of times to make sure the spice level was good for us  it was great in fact id say next time we might be willing to go up to medium  having ordered so much there was plenty to take home and our server boxed everything up for us so we didnt have to do it  when my bf ordered a heineken the server very astutely steered him to an indian beer  it was perfect with the foodthanks guru palace!  well definitely be back guru palace has so many highlights that its hard to pick just a fewthe lunchtime buffet provides the opportunity to mix dishes and im a huge fan of both their palak paneer and daal so a lunch trip is always my first choice (even though lunchtime wait service is on the slower side)their dinner menu is fairly basic but ive never had a dish that i disliked  and while i prefer the veg dishes the most the lamb vindaloo is also very very good i was disappointed the food is just too bland!my husband and i ordered a variety of food to get an idea of there food spectrum: garlic chicken kabob lamb vindaloo palak paneer garlic naan gulab jamun and rass malaithe only positives i saw was that the meat was cooked wellthats it! the sauces for each dish lacked flavor and spice my husband even requested indian spicy and it wasnt even spicyit tasted like a mild the garlic naan was decentat this point we were going to give it a 3barely! then the desserts camethe gulab jamun was firm and frozen and it seemed like they added extra butter/ghee to the syrup the rass malai was too thick and creamy it seemly like it was soaked in heavy cream which messed up the texture of the paneer and after we saw the bill their score plummeted to 2 it was not worth it so many of my classmates have gushed about how great the food is but i realized they probably dont know any better i grew up near little india around la where good indian food was no hard to find so i could just be spoiled = = = = = =  weekday lunch buffet!  = = = = = =wow with so many good indian restaurants in the valley it took almost 3 years to circle back around to this one but i finally got back here for lunch today joined by mike cthere were still a few little negatives:*  there is still some daytime light glare coming in from outside as there was last time but one of the two offending windows was well shaded this time so things were better*  almost all of the tables are still set for four or more diners with no booths available  (i did spot one lonely table for two but it was poorly placed in my opinion)*  there were only little dinky bowls available  they were suitable for small servings of the soupy vegetable dishes such as chana masala (chick peas) palak paneer (cooked spinach) & so on but too small for real soups such as daal  i had to use a tea mug to get a reasonable serving of itok on to the positives:*  the indian music played at reasonable volume this time*  the food is still delicious here!  (thats one thing isnt it?)     :-)*  the price included their terrific mango juice as well as tasty hot indian tea!     :-))*  the buffet selection is good here for an indian buffet at 25 items not counting sauces & dressingsthe dishes consisted of familiar indian recipes such as chicken tikki masala tandoori chicken goat masala tasty naan bread in your choice of plain or garlic & so on  spicing was moderateour table service was fine & at a very reasonable $899 theyre putting up an excellent indian buffet here which earned nearly 5 stars this time!     :-)),3.75,8
India Palace,i came in for the lunch buffet and i was surprised they had more options than my usual indian rotation (mint and mt everest) however this place was quantity more than quality the goat curry was really salty like really it masked the flavor of whatever spices they put the vegetable mikhana (veggie tikka masala) was off way off to a point it was sourish however the chicken mikhana (chicken tikka masala) was actually tasty i guess they cook it differently the chicken was so tender it was shredding apart i enjoyed their palak paneer as well but the paneer was too tough for my taste; it couldnt pick up the flavor of the spinach and spices overall i would not be able to fit this place into my rotation however service was great! my water was never empty and i was downing that water like crazy because of the goat curry i went in on a tuesday and they charged me 1195 which is not right according to the information on this listing or maybe they overcharged me what i liked about this place was that it was not as greasy as most indian restaurants in the us  unfortunately the flavors were somewhat bland  palak paneer was average  naan was ok  vegetable pakora was good soooo good! they used to be located on greenway and 32nd st 5 minutes away from my work i only have a half hour lunch break so i used to rush over their and stuff my face with as much of their delicious food from their lunch buffet as i could in 15 minutes but sadly they relocated we go there for dinner sometimes not as often as i wish because it is a 15 minute drive most of the time the service is very good the men that work there are very nice but the one lady that works there is kind of grumpy the food is mouth watering and delicious i feel they get the spice levels right a medium is a medium a little bit of heat but you can still taste the food favorite dishes are the palak paneer mali kofta and the garlic naan we like to wash it all down with the indian beer taj mahal,3.3333333333333335,3
Jewel of the Crown,love the lamb curry palak paneer daal curry and mutter paneer here  atmosphere is perfect- beautiful decor very inviting and just a great escape  i truly feel like ive gone on a mini-retreat every time i dine here (twice so far)  the sole reason i havent been back is it can get pricey  food while small in portion is terrific  authentic?  yes- you wont find beef in the menu!,4.0,1
OM Restaurant,as an indian i am rather fussy about food from my country and while i will often put up with mediocre offerings i am very pleased to report that the food here is very authentic and deliciousethnic food seems to finally be making some firm inroads in the henderson eastern corridor  om is the latest addition just south of serene - you have to look for it since it is set back a bit from the street  it is a relatively small restaurant with a definite take-out setup and vibe  the food is all laid out on a steam table and the menu choices are clearly displayed on big light boards behind the counter  the food is on display with matching photographs on the menu boardsthe basic premise is very similar to panda express - a side plus 2 entrees $699 with 3 entrees $899  sides offered are naan white rice pulao rice and noodles  as with pe you can select a half and half combo of two different sidesthree of us ate there and between us we tried the chicken tikka masala lamb vindaloo and chili chicken which were all terrific  on the vegetarian side of the menu we tasted the palak paneer aloo gobi and the daal  i didnt have any of the veggies but my friends gave them all a strong thumbs upi expect to be back there frequently both to eat there and for take out,5.0,1
Indian Paradise 2,= = = = = =  this review is for the weekday lunch buffet  = = = = = =stopped in to try this fairly new place today  it occupies the former home of a black bear diner which started out 5 stars with a line way out the door whenever you went & gradually deteriorated down to 1 star and true bear puckie awfulness before finally closing  eek!     :-ook so ip here has remodeled the dining room somewhat & its nice inside theres a full bar and your choice of tables or comfortable booths  the overall atmosphere lighting room temperature and soft indian music playing were all excellentthere was a 34 item selection of foods large for this type of buffet  hot tasty garlic naan bread arrived soon at my table as i went to get starting items including great mango juice and some tasty sambhar soup which had just right-sized china bowls to serve it up in as well as real soup spoons!  (no you cant take these things for granted at indian buffets)i also had some good tomato soup a salad with various toppings & then it was on to some chicken makhani (great!) chicken curry vegetable biryani chilis bhajias (something like chiles rellenos made with jalipeños) pakoras (tasty potato fritters) palak paneer paneer tikka masala navaratan korma tandoori chicken (of course) & moreit did take them a little while after opening to get all of the food out but everything was delicious and the service friendly and attentive     :-))lunch buffet $799 $1199 weekends  open every day at 11 am,4.0,1
India Grill,indian food is my favorite so i couldnt wait to try this new restaurant  we tried the buffet since there were just two of us and i wanted to try several dishes  it was wonderful  my two favorites baigan bharta and palak paneer were as good as i have ever had  i normally have to go to san rafael ca instead of two miles from my house to get food this good  at the buffet the dishes are labeled in american terms so i didnt have to translate for my husband  but its the real thing  i like my food medium so the vindaloo was too spicy for me but everything else was just right  we went in the evening so our tandoori chicken served on a sizzling platter at our table - great presentation and it really kept it hot (they said that at lunch its on the buffet)  the staff was very friendly and we found out that they had moved from stapley and the 60 to this much more convenient location  even the chai was good; usually i find it much too sweet  and although it disconcerted our waitress i like the sound of the train going by  we will definitely be regulars indian food and buffets are synonymous with lunch but almost unheard of for dinner and i think i know why timeone may eat lunch from 11-1 yet dinner can be from 5-8 that wide range means buffet items may not be as fresh as the should be and this was the case herethe palak paneer had a dry film over it from sitting as did the dahl the flavors of each dish were decent but not the best i have had i think they were a bit muted for american palletswhat made me happy was the large number of vegetarian items on the diner buffet ~5  including pakora dahl palak paneer veggie korma channa masala and one other dish plus the often over looked saladsbe sure or order the garlic naan as it is amazing in both taste and textureat 1199 its not a bargain for dinner but not bad for all you can eat dinner buffet!  they have a myriad of different vegetable dishes as well as meat dishes each with a distinct flavor  when we went today there were selections such as vegetable korma palak paneer paneer masala tandoori chicken butter chicken lamb vindaloo and goat curry just to name a few!  there was also a selection of chaat some pakora samosas a decent salad bar and 3 different desserts (fruit with mango pudding rice pudding and gulab jamun)   service was friendly and attentive  will definitely go here again if im in the mood for dinner buffet!ps  if you get the goat curry watch out for bones! we love this place!  its the best indian food weve found in the phoenix area  just about every dish on the buffet is delicious especially the butter chicken palak paneer and paneer makhani  the dinner buffet is $12 and they charge $6 for kids,4.25,4

Gandhi India's Cuisine,vegas is the land of the strip mall  seriously outside of downtown theyre everywhere and wedged in between all the nail salons and paycheck-advance stores you can find some pretty good restaurants if you dont mind the less-than-breathtaking surroundingsgandhi is a solid reliable indian restaurant that weve been going to for years  the building is mysteriously huge with super-high ceilings and a dining area that goes on for miles but it does fill up at peak times on the weekends  the decor is nothing fancy - bare white walls livened up with some wall hangings or framed pictures - but youre not there for the ambience youre there for tons of spicy foodwhen you sit down theyll plop some pappadom down in front of you (those crunchy cracker-like flatbreads) plus a mint-cilantro sauce and a sweet-and-sour sauce  i love this stuff but be judicious in your use of the spicy sauce because water service can be a bit slow hereeverything here is good especially the garlic naan  the tandoori chicken is yummy as is the rogan josh palak paneer and tikka masala  entrees range from $10--12 although they also have special tasting menus (including salad rice and dessert) that range from $15--22  they have a lunch buffet on weekdays thats also an excellent value  and theres a pretty good selection of beer and wine including a few indian beers to go with your mealnothing fancy decor- or ambience-wise gandhi nevertheless delivers good and reasonably priced indian food in a quiet and pleasant setting  if vegas isnt already hot enough for you spice it up with a trip to gandhi  and get the garlic naan! i cant believe this place had a banner outside calling it the best ethnic restaurant of las vegas  i dont remember what year or what company judged this place obviously the judges might have ate at this establishment years ago or the judges had been starvingfor days so that anything tastes delicious  prior to eating here my party was suggested by other frequent patrons that this place was hella good!i was very disappointed because as i walked in i noticed the buffet line  we were told that a la carte items were not offered so that means the buffet food has been sitting out or possibly left overs from yesterday!  the tandoori chicken was so dry and unflavorful  the lamb was full of flavor from all the spices but was just too tough  a lot of the vegatable dishes had more cauliflower than expected (filler???)so a lot of farting  ooh and that shredded carrot dessertyech  the only yummy thing was the tangy mango lassi  im not sure if one of the dishes i had was palak paneer  if it was it didnt taste like what ive had before   the decor of this place was so dated  it was white walled with a high ceiling with a huge rug above you  it was also very chilly inside  the buffet line took away the appeal and decor of the place  im assuming they went buffet style b/c of the lack of business  it is a hard find with mortons and buca di beppo right smack in front of you   i really do love indian food can somebody please help out hereis there a fantastic indian restaurant in las vegas?,2.5,2
