Tandoori Times Indian Bistro,tandoori timesvolume 1 issue 1 number 1  limited run  copyright 2009 mejimbo enterprises  all rights reserved  dateline 7 may 2009scottsdale arizona    yelpers jim w and audrey w were reportedly seen enjoying lively conversation and delicious indian food with donald s and carin s  witnesses claim the group was laughing loudly at times  one bystander reported that was a guffaw  that outburst right there was definitely a guffaw  wild stuff    sources have related to this publication that the group dined on two appetizers one known as a bread basket which consisted of four types of naan bread  jim w was overheard to say i really like the onion naan  the other appetizer may have been aloo tikki  this has not been confirmed as yet  in any case the plate containing the reported aloo tikki was cleaned by the foursome several even going so far as to swab at the remaining sauce on the plate    the above sources also reported that the table was served an order of the friday daily special of kahari shrimp  it was overheard by a nearby table that the shrimp was flavorful with strong notes of garlic and ginger  this has not substantiated however    audrey w reportedly was served the lamb korma which she was rumored to have noted was yummy    carin s apparently was served the chicken masala and donald s may have been served some sort of vindaloo that included potato  it seems there was considerable sharing of the dishes around the table and the main dishes may have been spooned over what some experts have suggested was a basmati rice with various herbs and spices    an unnamed source has informed this publication that while jim w claims to have particularly enjoyed the food and festive atmosphere which included a belly dancer and some swordplay he was displeased with the excessive sound level produced by the in-house sound system and even requested that the music be reduced    jim ws blog had a statement this morning that read in part; ears havent hurt the next morning like that since my last rock concert  i really liked the food but i wouldnt go back on a night when they have dancing again maybe i was lucky; maybe i was just too desperate for a good indian meal; i dont know but my experience here was fabulous  i cant in good conscience give it a 5 star rating because i know of better places in ca but - on a scale of phoenix area indian places this would get a 5 star rating no problem ive been looking for a good indian place for over a year and i saw this place over a year ago but decided it was too fancy and could not rationalize a good indian place in such an upscale suburban setting so i kept passing it up   in the meantime ive been to mesa tempe and chandler in search of the solution most times i dont even walk in the door  im sorry but - as a lone diner im not interested in being the only patron at 7pm plus what does that tell you about the food if no one is there?  i walked into tt at 7:30pm on a friday night and it was busy!  that was a big plus  and most of the patrons looked indian - another big plus for some reason id gotten it into my head that this was a fancy spot but in fact the interior is simply nicely done  head and shoulders above most indian places for sure but - definitely not stuffy or over-fancy  many people have mentioned the incredibly slow service  my waiter is maybe a yelp reader because he told me - these tandoori appetizers shouldnt be called appetizers they should say 20-30 minutes to cook  he suggested i get my tandoori appetizer at the same time as my main dish - good advice i had the goat curry which was outstanding and the tandoori lamb chops - which was not perfect - way more pieces than i imagined but thinly sliced and not as juicy as i had hoped  the rice was absolutely perfect - basmati rice with some whole cloves dotted throughout the naan bread was also perfect - really really perfect and made the meal a perfect treat just as my meal arrived  boom  the music got loud and out jumped  a belly dancer!  this was not what i was in the mood for and at first i felt the evening was ruined  but - she was good and really worked the crowd as it were and made an effort to engage everyone some tables got up and danced with her leading to a rather festive atmosphere overall a plus but im glad it was only one reasonably short session in summary - good food nice place nice atmosphere and head-and-shoulders above anything else ive found in the phoenix metro so far (eastern edge - i dont get over to the west) hubby and i decided to eat outside the box for our latest date night this is definitely a good place to go if you typically dont have a very adventurous palate! the music was a *tad* loud and our server was on the slow side but otherwise we had a great experience trying some new dishes i had the lamb curry and it was very good hubby had the saturday special some kind of beef (cant remember the name) and it was very good and just a little spicy the garlic naan and basmati rice were to die for! eaten here twice this week- delicious indian food!!! my fianc√© and i are visiting from iowa and honestly cannot get enough of this place their staff bobbi and joel were really kind and helpful they know the menu in and out and joel had great suggestions i had the chicken korma and it was perfect recommend getting an order of naan- plain and pesto were really good also a must have is their delicious basmati rice oh and dont forget to get a mango lassi- theyre really tasty another great thing is that their happy hour is from 5-7 and they have a great selection of well priced drinks its pretty challenging to find this location- its on the north west corner of via ventura and hayden road google maps has it wrong persevere its worth it!!!!,4.25,4,8140 N Hayden Rd Ste H115 Scottsdale AZ 85258
India Oven,this review is based on my first time eating at an indian place!went to this place as a suggestion from my friendjon who loves this placewent on a friday night and it was pretty empty there was about 5 parties there ranging from 1 to 6 people pet tablethe staff seemed pretty bored which added to the boring ambience theres nothing that makes it scream indian restaurant our wait staff was pretty good always there when we neededthey gave us a little too much time to over view the menuill start off with the appetizerstheres a complimentary plate of a baked type of chip? thats served with 2 different sauces one was sweet and red like a thin chutney the other was spicier and green like a salsa verde overall it reminded me of chips and salsa we ordered meat samosas to start theyre pretty much ground beef empanadas with indian seasonings overall it was good but definitely not a stand out id go back for very mildi ordered a tasting dinnerthis came with: basmati rice naan a goat curry a chicken curry and a shrimp curry it was also served with a cool cucumbery white sauce and a sweet dessert cupthe portions were good; enough to sharealthough it was all really good the food definitely tasted like it just came out of serving pots the only one that seemed like the meat was stewed in the curry was the goat the chicken and shrimp servings came off as if the chicken or shrimp was added into the sauce before being brought out also the three different curries seemed to be of varying heat the goat was most mild then the chicken and then the shrimp being the spiciest id definitely recommend getting this meat dinner if youve never had indian food you get a little taste of everythingthe menu was definitely hard to understand theres one goat  one veggie one seafood and one chicken section each with about 6-8 different options to have your choice of entree inthe descriptions really dont give any idea of what to expect from what you order ie chicken in spicy curry sauce vs chicken in very spicy curry saucei hated the seating of this place they should definitely get a new interior designer the tables are so close with no booths! i felt like i was unintentionally eaves dropping everyones conversationsfor food: id definitely give the food a 45 out of five the only complaint would be my food wasnt served completely piping hot one dish was warm while the others werent ect but taste was definitely awesome! all the curries were different like i ordered three different dishes and eating with naan or rice changed the tastes tooservice: 4 out of 5 it was satisfactory and i have no complaints but nothing spectacularprice: 3 out of 5 im a huge fan of thai curry but it just doesnt seem worth it for the price my meal with one mango lassi(which was underwhelming) and samosas($7) was about $45 its about 2 cups of curry rice and naan for $21-24 dollars i would definitely go back! but only when i want to splurge id rather go get thai curry :] wow this place was awesome! i felt like i was whisked away to an indian palace this place was decorated nicely with indian vases and paintings with lots of chandeliers  they also play indian music now for the best partthe food was delicious! i went on a sunday for the buffet during lunch and i had a $695 coupon from the newspaper (which is in the paper every single week) quite a bargain when we saw all the different choices they also have all you can drink mango lassi at the buffet! when you arrive they bring you a plate of freshly grilled garlic naan and they ask if youd like more when you polish it offbut we didnt need more after the first serving which was more than plenty  all of the food was so fresh and hot and full of wonderful flavors my favorite was the tika chiken masala basmati rice and spinach paneer the goat curry was also fabulous and the meat was super tender the waitresses and other staff members were very friendly and attentive i am definitely a fan and plan to return for the buffet again very very soon!!!!! i love it here! i only have gone here a couple of times for the buffet but i think thats the smart way to go!i had my first indian food experience here so i have nothing to really compare to i did have the buffet during lunch and dinner and there are only minor differences but the food is always delicious! i love how they bring hot garlic naan out to your table and refill it once its gone i love trying new food and the buffet help me do just that i get to taste a little bit of everything without having to waste food or burn a hole in my wallet now i know what i like [: the bf at the time loves their chicken tikka masala which i agree is absolutely amazing! but i also love their yogurt sauce and the mint chutney i seem to want to put those 2 sauces all over everything i eat oh and i love the basmati rice! its so different from all the rice i ever tried before but in a good way!the staff is real friendly and always refill your drinks and make sure you have everything you need all the time if you want indian food you should definitely come here! amazing delicious food and friendly service win win! my wife and i went here for lunch today  now just for clarification my wife is not one to enjoy foods that are ethnicshe left this place raving  the lamb was delicious as was the basmati rice  hmm the naan (flatbread) was divine  even the deserts were delicious: cheese donut thing carrot pudding and this amazing mango puddingthe two of us enjoyed a delicious and filling lunch in a wonderful atmosphere for about $20 bucks not bad! i took my 16 month old son here this weekend while my husband and daughter were seeing a movie together no one in my family likes ethnic food (and i am persian!) so its important to me to expose my son to as many types of foods possible while hes still young and open i took him in for the buffet at 5:00 pm on the dot i wanted to get in early since it is a busy night for restuarants and i didnt know how well he would behave i got a plate with a little bit of everything on it as well as a small plastic salad plate (empty) for him to eat off of in the meantime we got our bread and the wait staff was very helpful making sure i had what i needed for him they brought a spoon and paper napkins to the table and had taken away the second fork before i had even returned from the buffet i was impressedhe played around with the food at first but really got going towards the end he really liked the basmati rice and the lentil stew (i can never remember the names) after that he decided he really loved the rice with chicken and veggies he ate and ate and ate the waiter (owner maybe?) seemed really happy that he was digging the food towards the end i got my son some watermelon and had to go back to the buffet about 5 times for another piece i dont like to be wasteful so we only grabbed a slice at a timeall in all the food was great! i am sorry to say but arizona has some of the worst indian food around i am glad that there is a place i can go to around here now the buffet is awesome and is so inexpensive i fully expected to be charged at least for an adult and a child at the buffet (my son eats a lot) but i was pleasantly surprised when i got my bill for $10 it almost made me feel guilty!i definitely recommend first time last night at the indian oven after searching high and low for some good indian that rivals what i get in england when i travel there  i like this place a lot!  it lacks a lot of the dark tablecloth and somewhat dreary feel you get in many of the places in town  the restaurant appears clean and the service is exceptional  we had a steady flow of nan which was cooked perfectly and had great texture  i got a taj mahal beer which was served with a deeply frosted mug  when ice cold this is an exceptional beer as is the slightly lighter bodied kingfisher  the buffet is great and offers dishes divided between meat-based and vegetarian which is cool if you are not familiar with the dishes  they had a lamb vindaloo that had great flavor but lacked some of the heat i am used to with vindaloo dishes  i did hear the table next to me comment on how spicy it was so perhaps this is just my tastes and preference  all of the dishes i had were excellent  the basmati rice was served out of a rice cooker which seemed a little off considering everything else was is long pans  the lamb was a little dry perhaps because it was slightly over cooked?  all of the chicken dishes were exceptional as were the veggie  i also ordered a side of papadum which are great if you have kids  they did not serve it with the traditional spicy chutney i am used to though but they did nail the green cilantro based saucei few of my pet peeves that this place passed on was perfectly filtered arizona water  no chemical or hard water flavors so they must have a good ro system  the other was that when the bill was delivered they kept filling waters and asked us if they could get us anything until we left which again speaks to their high level of service  the wait staff were dressed neatly and groomed to the extent that i wondered how i could get my facial hair so tighta great night and experience and i look forward to my next visit,4.666666666666667,6,1315 S Gilbert Rd Mesa AZ 85204
Royal India Bistro,omg! i wish we had found this restaurant the day we arrived in vegas!the buffet is under 14$ and the food on the buffet is extremly freshthe chicken tandoori is so delicious  the basmati rice is delicate and had authentic flavors the naan ( bread) was out of this worldwe also had a very fresh salads  and the lentil dish was exquisitetry the sweet rice with fresh fruit delicious!now you should see the decor of this restaurant  its spacious and luxurious  like an island in the heart of the hotel rioits a greatly non smoking space  thank god for that!i have to add to my review the extremly welcoming warm  attention ate  details oriented service everyone in this restaurant is an absolute sweethearti will defently comeback we went to the $14 (11am to 4pm) lunch buffet  we had been there twice before for dinner when it was gaylord and both experiences were quite similar; nice ambiance good but overpriced food lousy service  so i was excited they were back (same owners new name) and could do a major affordable chow down and not have to worry about the service because it was a buffet  really what could possibly go wrong?so there we are-nobody to seat us-so i poke my head into the dining area and someone comes and ushers us to a table in a near empty room  i look around; wow design fallout!  the gaylord to india bistro remodel is more of a demodel what was once a rather upscale and attractively appointed space has been dehabbed with cheesy booths and a tacky over bright chandelier oh well moving onthe buffet consisted of: dal maharani  baingan pakoras (eggplant) aloo baingan (think it was potato and eggplant) palak paneer  basmati rice tandoori chicken chicken tikka masala chicken curry and some expired salada little heavy on the chicken and eggplant but i was still ok with thatuntil i discovered that every chicken dish was a contender for the food despair jackpot  the one commonality they all shared was their styrofoam taste and consistency  it was the worst rice i have ever had and we debated if it was old or undercooked settling on the notion that it was probably both  everything else pretty much sucked as well  there are people starving in (fill in the blank) and they would probably choose hunger over that buffet  the only plus:our server kept us attentively stocked with the only palatable things we had:garlic naan & water formerly known as gaylord royal india bistro can be found in the exact same place as it was before inside the rio casino with the same owner and almost the same menu the interior of this place is now more sophisticated plush and cozy with spacious booths lining around the walls of the restaurant i remembered fondly from my past visits as this was my favorite indian restaurant in las vegas the delicious and creamy korma entrees be it chicken lamb or vegetable korma is always amazing on top of fluffy basmati rice there is no words to describe the taste and the feeling of the first few spoonful of lamb korma and rice really you just have to experience it indian food just isnt the same after tasting this item because youll want to come back again and again for more of this delicious and heavenly korma curry i dont know if i can ever order anything else on the menu here - im too spoiled by this item and ill just want what i love over and over again sure they have really great curry and chicken tandoori creamy spinach cauliflower and carrots but addiction has its limit as my tummy is only limited in space the items to get here if you ever come here is the korma (lamb chicken or vegetable) creamy spinach and cauliflower trust me you will not be disappointed this has to be the best indian restaurant in las vegas that is all i went to the royal india bistro for the lunch buffet today  lunch was very good and service was excellent i was the first person here at about 11:30 but several tables were occupied before i left  the server asked me for my drink order  i got tap water which  she then said they had a buffet and i replied that was the reason i was there  she gestured for me to go ahead and start and shed get my naanthe buffet is small by comparison to other indian buffets in town  there are 8 hot dishes some salad and achaar  it was a good enough choice and the good taste of the food made up for the limited selectionthe naan was buttered generously and was a welcome addition to the mealfor my first trip i got chicken tikka masala malai kofta and some basmati rice  the thing i noticed about all of their dishes was they all had a nice spicy flavor  its not overpowering for people who like mild food but it had a definite tang and it was not just one dish but all of them  it was the first time i know that i had malai kofta and it was really a treat!  the last thing was the vegetable pakora  this was a bit disappointing  i didnt read the full description because i know what it is  the only vegetable i could see/taste was potato  it seemed more like it was a pakora made from bread stuffing and some potatofor the second plate i had aloo matar daal maharani and curry chicken  the aloo matar and curry chicken were good  the daal was ok  the sign said spicy lentils but this was the only dish that was lacking in spice  there were some beans mixed in the daal toofor dessert i got some rice pudding and some carrot pudding  the rice pudding was not labeled as kheer and it had a lot of liquid with less rice unlike kheer or rice puddings ive had before  the carrot pudding on the other hand was very thick and unlike the carrot puddings ive had elsewhere  both puddings were very good--im not criticizing them but merely pointing out the different preparation  i wish i had seen the achaar at the beginning of my meal  i didnt think it would be as tasty with dessert!service as i said was very good  when i went for my second plate my dirty plate was removed and my water glass refilled  the server was very pleasant  the room is quite nice and it was very quiet  the price is just over $16 including tax  for the limited selection its higher than most places  also you have to park and walk your way through the casino to get there and its right in the middle halfway between either garagestill i wont hesitate to stop here and i think ill try it for dinner some evening,3.5,4,3700 West Flamingo Rd Las Vegas NV 89103
Shalimar Restaurant,going to have to buck the yelp trend a bit here and rate this one 25 stars overallothers have commented about the lack of ambiance here and ill have to agree the restaurant is very plain and we went our tablecloth was a bit dirty and there was a vaguely unpleasant smell in the air the smell was probably just an unfortunate combination of spices and foods from the kitchen but this could really do with being closed off from the serving area not only to prevent a medley of odors but so the diner isnt deafened by clattering of pots and pans and so oni ordered chicken tikka masala garlic naan pappadums the basmati rice and water for my beverage  instead of the usual indian restaurant theme of refreshingly iced water topped up the second i sip from my glass i was surprised to be presented with a single bottle of kroger water which i had to sip sparingly lest i have to shell out another dollar for anotherthe pappadums were ok but unremarkable not unlike the pre-made ones you get from indian grocers and then stick in the microwave for 45 seconds instead of the usual bowls of mint or cilantro chutney and tamarind chutney these came accompanied by a couple of roadhouse diner style squeeze bottles filled with some sort of condiments both were extremely runny almost a water consistency one seemed to taste vaguely of tamarind and i couldnt identify the othermy garlic naan was the highlight of my meal and had that certain mix of denseness and crispness thats the hallmark of a good garlic naanthe rice was pretty good also cooked with saffron and ghee and very plentiful for just a couple of bucksthe main meal my chicken tikka masala was just ok - the chicken was of good quality and well cooked but the sauce lacked a certain deft touch and was a little aggressive as the spices didnt all blend together quite how i like id be very happy if i had cooked this up myself at home but its a notch below what i expect at a restaurantthe people running this place were very friendly but it was a rather odd experience at around 8pm we were the only people in the restaurant and it was a little strange and awkward having the guy sitting there in the tiny restaurant 15 feet from us while we ate one thing in shalimars favour is the prices - they are very decent we didnt hold back on breads and rice and things and our entire meal for two (including bottled water) came to just over $25this is the sort of place i could imagine myself coming to regularly for a cheap lunch if i worked in the area and was limited in where i could travel on my lunch break the food is good enough and cheap enough to eat again for a dinner out; however the atmosphere here is little above that of a food court and the food is only a few points above mediocre worth a look for the price but go in with low expectations oh man the interior of this place needs a gordon ramsay make over  it kind of looks more like an office rather than restaurant  i ordered take out and the food was surprisingly delicious  bhuna gosht and daal masala were great with the garlic naan  the basmati rice (ordered seperately) was also very flavorful  if anything the lamb was slightly overpriced for the portion  this place needs more customers!! gotta try it!,3.0,2,4001 S Decatur Blvd Ste 31 & 32 Las Vegas NV 89103
India Garden,our fave india restaurant closed in goodyear so we decided to try this india garden  the restaurant is big and open  bollywood music videos were playing on the tvs  when we got there we were the 2nd table of people in the whole place  they serve both menu and buffet  we opted to try the buffet since it looked good  we headed for the buffet  the dinner buffet consists of twenty different items  i got the basmati rice tandoori chicken chicken masala vegetable samosa and kheer  everything was wonderful  there was a lot more in the buffet but i over did it  oh also naan (we got the garlic naan) is included with the buffet they will bring it to your table fresh!   and hot chai tea  all that was $1099 per person i usually come here for the lunch buffet for two reasons:  1) its a better value; and 2) the variety of dishes to select  having said that though the dinner was delicious and the service very thoughtful and kind  i had shrimp curry (a little light on the curry) spinach and cubed cheese (perfectly spiced for me) and eggplant (also perfectly spiced for me)  included was some garlic naan (yum) and basmati rice  just water to drink i spent about $40 where the lunch buffet costs $10  there you have it,4.0,2,1809 N Dysart Rd Ste C106 Avondale AZ 85392

Saffron,mediterranean/mexican fusion? when we first walked into this establishment we were shocked by the run-down decor there were numerous holes in the walls and just an overall tackiness that made this no one was there to welcome us into the restaurant the lady began to walk us to a table a customer complained and she abandoned us so we had to find our own tablewhen we began to place our order the compact disc on the kenwood stereo began to skip so our order took a backseat to fixing the scratched cd playing ok so this place stinks! no literally it smells like old camel assi guess all the ocean breeze renuzits were there to camouflage the camel smell but it didnt work trust me our water came without ice the ice upon demand came out in a mini casserole dish with a pair of ice tongs as we looked around the room at the other customers tables we realized that maybe bottled water was the way to go perhaps the leftover bottle caps on our table should have been an indicationoh did i mention that the leopard printed table cloth was hiding an uneven table that tilted when we put our drinks upon it? the leopard table cloth was the top layer of 5 different table covers there were several plastic table covers nunderneath the leopard cloth that had stains and old crusted food upon themanyway the surprise came when the food arrived it was surprisingly delicious! the kabob appetizer actually came in the form of a wrap with lots of fresh veggies and tender chicken who knew? also the chicken makhani was delicious we had to order the basmati rice and an order of garlic naan a la carte oh did i mention that they also do quinceneras? egad!,2.0,1,3230 E Desert Inn Rd Eastside Las Vegas NV 89121
Hurry 4 Curry,i visited hurry 4 curry on a saturday evening for a take away dinner i believe i visited on their second or third day of operationi entered a restaurant with modern decor that was spotlessly clean having read about the restaurant in the republic prior to arriving i immediately headed towards one of the two flat screen televisions to place my order ordering was easy and quick and the menus offered descriptions of the indian food for those who may be unfamiliar with the cuisinei ordered butter chicken naan bread and basmati rice this came to $850 it was a pleasure to see as is done in many other countries that the tax was included in the price of each item while i could have swiped my credit card to pay at the menu monitor i chose to pay cash and received service from the friendly lady at the cash register she also validated my parking in the az center garage my butter chicken (you can choose naan or rice as a side) was $750 and my naan was another dollar which brought the total cost of my meal to $850 because i was ordering take away i did not order a drink i did however see that the restaurant is applying for a liquor license; presumably for the sale of beer given that there is no bar in the quick service spaceafter a wait of maybe five minutes i received my food in what one might describe as higher-quality chinese food boxes the naan bread was wrapped in foilafter a short drive home i transferred my food from box to plate and began to enjoy my dinner while the rice was very well cooked (generally fluffy and not clumped together) the naan (as the republic also reported) was somewhat disappointing while it was definitely naan and not pita bread i found my serving to be almost cracker-like in texture and too cool of a temperature (i assume this may be because the naan was prepared earlier in the day i wonder though if they could have devised a way to warm the bread before serving in a convection oven?) my butter chicken was flavorful but also rather cool in temperature portion sizes were more than adequatewhen i visited the restaurant was empty because i hope this restaurant will survive (i think the concept is novel) i sent some of the concerns detailed above in the form of constructive criticism to the restaurant after eating my dinner would i return? sure i enjoyed a healthy filling and flavorful dinner for a fair price and when i return i will be happy to adjust my star rating upwards if some minor improvements have been made,3.0,1,Arizona Center 400 E Van Buren St Phoenix AZ 85004
India Masala,butter chicken!hmm what to make of this place its indian food in a food court in a strip hotel ok so its the riviera but stillcutting to the chase the butter chicken was yummy it had bell peppers in it which stood out for some reason maybe because there usually arent bell peppers in butter chicken? idk i liked what they brought to the party the plate comes with a good amount of basmati rice and a ginormous piece of naan in my book it doesnt get much better than savoring some delicious butter chicken sauce with some naanso the food was good but back to the place the fact that we even have indian food in a food court in this town makes me happy the down side is that youre paying more for it like i said its in a strip hotel albeit the riviera theyre probably paying a lot for that location so their prices are naturally higher i mean $12 for a plate of butter chicken isnt insane but it just feels weird because youre in a freakin food courtin any case i left satisfied i wouldnt go out of my way to eat there again but id consider it if im ever back in the riviera like the next time i watch some roller derby!ps i pretty much always order mango lassi if they offer it ive had better but it was pretty good,4.0,1,Riviera Hotel and Casino 2901 Las Vegas Blvd S The Strip Las Vegas NV 89109
Indian Cavalry Club,we were in edinburgh for a few days and staying at the caledonian waldorf astoria hotel which is only a few mins walk from this restaurant  we wanted to have a nice indian meal and decided to give this place a try  that was where we went wrongthe concierge at the hotel called ahead for us  when we arrived at the restaurant we were seated in the front room  restaurant is simple and classy looking and it was only about 1/2 fullwe were given menus and ordered drinks right away while we were placing our food order the drinks arrived  out of our party of 4 one person only wanted water and a few of us asked for water alsoit took us 5 mins plus to order as the menu is a little complicated and they carry some untraditional itemswe ordered some starters and also wanted some rice with them this took time  the menu said plain basmati rice when we said we want some plain basmati rice we received some snotty comment about all of the rice dishes being basmati rice we finally got the waiter to understand what rice we wanted at which point he questioned why we wanted rice with the appetizers (we want it thats why)then came the main dishes i wanted some kheem (traditional indian lamb curry)  waiter decided to educate me on what kheema is then he told me that they had minced lamb but wanted to know what curry/sauce i wanted it with  i asked i picked one and he told me that i should try something else he suggested another dish which i said i dont enjoy he told us that if i had it in america then i should still try it here as americans dont know how to cook (2 of us are american so this too did not go over well)we finally finished ordering and the drinks arrived no water or glass of iceso we asked about it and were told to be patient and that it was cominga little while later our papad (poppodum) was brought out  once we finished with these the appetizers came out  they decided to bring out the food without clearing the table so we had to help clear the plates so they had space to put the food downwe had ordered some chocked pakoras masala dosa lamb kebabs and a prawn an potato crepefood was ok nothing spectacular  when the started were brought to the table we asked for more chutney and specifically asked for some tamarind and some green chutney half way through the appetizers we stopped eating and finally got the attention of one of the waiters to ask them about the chutneys as we needed them to eat out food  again were were dismissed rudely and told it was comingwaiters were just standing around taking as not doing anything this was the last straw so we told them we wanted to see a manager and to cancel our entrees the wait staff told us we could not do that as our food was already ordered  told them to get a manager on the phoneafter asking for the manager our regular waiter came by and just started talking to us as if nothing had happened  i stopped him and told him again to call the manager and to cancel our main courseswe paid for what we had consumed and left  on our way out we spotted another person who said that he was one of the owners we spoke with him and the waiter for a few mins but the waiter was just defensive and didnt think he had done anything wrongwe walked out and went to mother india  avoid indian cavalry club at all costs service is atrocious and there are better ways to waste your money and more importantly time,1.0,1,22 Coates Crescent West End Edinburgh EH3 7AF
Indian Delhi Palace,we arrived at 2:30 with a craving for something that wasnt mexican food or contemporary food we were seated and told there was a lunch all-you-can-eat buffet going on we looked over the menu but decided after all on the buffet it was a good idea to try some new things since i always get matar paneer i filled a plate and proceeded to stuff my face in classy form of course the aloo mattar had the perfect amount of spice and an immense amount of flavor it was impressive as was the chicken curry the rice and the chicken masala i was in heaven! the garlic naan was perfect everything was right with the worldthen the bad news came not fifteen minutes after we sat down with our first plates filled were we told the buffet was going to close soon had we known earlier well im not sure what we would do but it sure is lucky we are a couple of small ladies who cant really eat more than one overfilled plate i thoughti finished my plate and decided to have more aloo mattar rice and then some raiti and fritters then i got some of the coconut basmati rice oh everything just sighhh i think it was the first time ive really been rendered speechless by food in a long time tl;dr service was friendly but didnt come around often enough to fill our drinks food is incredible the place is relaxing and aesthetically appealing insidethey lost a star for the failure to tell us we had fifteen minutes to enjoy the buffet and for being a little lagging on the refilling of drinks two reasons for coming here: 1) you love indian food2) you love to sample a variety of dishes my first visit to the palace was on a friday for the lunch buffet  for $799 you have your pick of tandoori chicken a delicious chicken curry three vegetable curries basmati rice daal naan and salad to complete your feast they offer kheer (rice pudding with almond and pistachio) and gulab jamun (two balls akin to donut holes - made from cream of milk in scented light syrup)the greatest thing about this buffet is that it is western friendly  this means that none of the curries are too spicy and even the mint chutney is not over-powered by peppers and chilies  for your first experience with indian food this is a terrific spot  if a seasoned veteran of this cuisine you may be more picky where flavor is concernedi personally feel the buffet had very slim pickings especially for someone that enjoys diversity in dining  however i thought the tikka masala chicken curry daal pakoras and saag were sooo deliciousi am interested in returning here to explore its dinner options  for example along with the varying lamb chicken and vegetarian dishes indian delhi palace offers - they have complete dinners for under $20  for instance the chicken dinner includes one papadum one tandoori chicken chicken curry one daal maharani one plate of basmati rice one naan one ratia one dessert chutney and tea delhi palace saved my dinner party! i was getting over a nasty 24-hour bug and was panicked about how on earth i was going to be able to pull off a vegetarian duel birthday dinner party for my scorpio-signed non-meat eating folks my boyfriend suggested ordering a bunch of food for everyone i was non-too-thrilled by this suggestion but felt i had nothing better to offer cooking cleaning and preparing for the party would have surely put me over the edge so i went along with itthe responsibility of ordering for everyone sort of put me in a state of quiet anxiety but i knew i needed to bite the bullet  ordering for 13 people i got the following:apps3 vegetable pakora (6/order) apps - too salty over done wouldnt order again5 samosa (2 large per order) apps - we split them in 2 so there would be 20 they were gone in minutes  so delicious and really reasonable at $249/orderdinner1 vegetable korma - excellent should have ordered 2 of them2 daal maharani - excellent and there was nothing left2 bengan bharta - too salty wouldnt order this again hardly touched2 palak paneer - excellent a true hit1 malai kofta - delicate and deliciousoh how could i forget we ordered lots of garlic naan and a platter of basmati rice  the apps came with mint chutney and tamarind chutney and i ordered raita (cool whipped yogurt) to drizzle over the spicy prepsdinner was around $170 it was entirely worth it  no stress no mess and everyone was thanking us for the indian treats plus we had indian food for dinner the next night!what i gleaned from this experience was i could have definitely ordered less food  there was tons of left overs  i would say that one dinner dish safely satisfies 2 guests  favorites were: palak paneer vegetable korma daal maharani garlic naan samosasone last thing this place has the best indian buffet in town if youre into that sort of thing (wink) i cooked dinner at home the last four nights in a row this may be a record for me  no joke!  we eat out way too much  but as a reward for all of my cooking as of late my husband took me out to dinner tonighti suggested we try indian delhi palace and he agreed!we walked in and were immediately greeted by nick mr delhi palaces son  nick is a college student with one hell of a sense of humor  the banter between him and jared made for one comical meal  heres what we ate:-garlic naan-peas pulaou (basmati rice cooked with peas)-fresh okra with sliced onions gentle herbs and mild spices-bengan bhartha (eggplant roasted in a delightful pulp seasoned with gentle herbs and mild spices)-shrimp tikka masala-kheer (basmati rice pudding sprinkled with almonds and pistachio)everything was extremely tasty especially the okra and shrimp dishes  i normally do not like dishes that have onion in them but pretty much everything we had contained a lot of it  and actually i still liked it!the serving sizes were large so we took home leftovers  the price was a bit steep ($60 out the door) but we really enjoyed it  i think this will be my new go-to place for indian food and my new go-to place for dinner when i pick up friends and family at the airport around dinner timeas a side note the indian delhi palace building also has a large banquet room upstairs that nick showed us upon our inquiry it has a capacity of 250 and its really nice  future yelp event potential perhaps?  well see about that let me just preface this review by saying that it does pain me to write a negative review about almost any establishment in the valley  unfortunately for india delhi it has to be done  honestly i have not dined inside this restaurant my experience is purely from multiple take out orders over the past yearliving in arcadia and loving food as i do i am lucky in the fact that i do not have to travel far to enjoy ethnic culinary delights that other cultures have to offer  if your a foodie in the 21st century indian food is all over your radar  india delhi found at 54th street and mcdowell in phoenix fits the bill of almost every other indian restaurant in the valley nice external building clean looking restaurant and the normal tinctures related to that region of the world  always friendly and eager to take your order the young gentleman at the front counter has never let me down in taking care of my to go order always checking each container to make sure it has the correct contents etc  on the saturday i am referencing for this review the young man was not there but the owner and his wife were in my opinion indian food is not a cheap venture i always find myself wanting to try a dish as well as getting a staple that i know is going to be solid when you add in the extra charge for rice(never included) yogurt sauce(not included) etc the bill for myself and companion always tops $40  i usually do not gripe as i know the quality will be there and i just love the food what can i sayon this saturday though something was different this was evident from the moment i walked in the door i could not put my finger on it but something was just not vibing  the owners wife(or co owner for all i know) was at the counter and asked if i wanted the buffet i politely turned it down as i am not a fan of buffet food especially with indian cuisine  i politely turned that down and proceeded to order tandoori chicken saag paneer chicken biryani basmati rice and some naan  what happened next is not something i will forget soon  i watched as the owner walked out of the kitchen with the pan in hands and used the spinach for my saag paneer from the buffet  the owners and my eyes met as he processed that i saw what he was doing  in that moment the owner sold and gave up all his culinary credibility he proceeded to head back to the kitchen to use said items  i waited for another fifteen minutes and took my order home  what did i find? the chicken biryani the only item i might add not in the buffet was extremely hot almost too hot to touch  the saag paneer was warm at best the tandoori chicken was a collection of small legs(customary for indian buffets) and once again not hot  i knew what had happened and could not help feeling beyond annoyed with the situation normally i just deal with what is i do not ever send food back and especially on to-go orders  this time was different i could not let it go  i called the restaurant and without pause the owner got on knowing exactly who i was and what the problem was he put up a fight for around 20 seconds saying that he just used the spinach as a base for the saag paneer and what not but then finally just apologized and said he would make it right  i do not really see myself going back here but who knows  this is a good excuse to venture out and try some more of the valleys offerings in this arena after a hard day of racing go karts at octane we stopped in here for a lunch break it is sunday and they have a buffet for 10 bucks i was quite impressed with the buffet offerings there is chikpea salad (ok not great) about 6 curry meat options and 4 curry vegetable offerings along with the basmati rice and 2 desert options i enjoyed all the veggie options the curries were thick and full of lentils/spinach/potatoe etc the rice was fluffy despite being in a buffet even the pudding desert dish with cashews and raisins was tasty a bit sweet but good there are about 6 chutneys and sauces to compliment your dish if you choose i always like the yogurt ones the achar was way too salty for me our indian guest was well pleased and we took that as a good sign they passed the water glass test with flying colors very formal interiors and the staff was quiet yet polite and professional a great dining spot for curry lovers i have eaten off the menu before and thoroughly enjoyed it as well we went here for lunch and got the buffet for around $10 the chickpea salad was ok not the best ive had i got a scoop of basmati rice and enjoyed all four veggie dishes (creamed spinach spiced lentils spiced cabbage and curried vegetables) the vegetable fritters would have been good if they were freshly put out but they were cold and a little too hard/crunchy the multiple sauces were delicious and sort of fun to get a bunch of samples and try with your meal or dip with the naan bread oh and the naan by the way was fantastic they brought an order to the table and it must have just come out of the oven as it was super hot and toasty mmmmmmmthere were two desserts on the buffet a sweet pudding with almonds and cashews and a fried dough with honey  both were tasty but again i think the fried dough sat out a while so it was more chewy vs crispy and the pile was all sticking together the service was prompt with removing our plates and refilling water glasses all in all very tasty food! i wouldve given 5 stars if it wasnt for a few of those buffet items being a bit stale,3.857142857142857,7,5104 E McDowell Rd Phoenix AZ 85008
Indian Paradise 2,the lunch buffet was decent with standard indian dishes found in the other indian buffet restaurants i enjoyed the tandoori chicken tikka masala lentil and curry dishes all of which went well with their fragrant basmati rice i found the other dishes to be just ok including the limited dessert options service was friendly and the place is clean and spacious - not suprising for a building that used to be a black bear diner,3.0,1,2410 W Bell Rd Phoenix AZ 85023
Passage To India,the worst indian joint i have been to in az dont get me wrong the place is decked up with nice tables chairs and lighting only problem is that without good food or good service none of that matters went there on a friday night aroung 7pm waiter took about 15 mins to come over food took more than 30 mins after ordering and when it did come out it was cold! i ordered the goat biryani and for those of you who know what this is will understand why i was pissed that they brought out steamed basmati rice with goat curry under the rice (2 piece of meat that were 80% bone) told them good luck and took off dont waste your time or money on this place food and managment are well below par! a soild lunch buffet for ~11 however i would not mind it being a dolar less due to few veg optionsthe flavors were vibrant in the saag and pakora the soup was a bit too salty but still good however they only had foam cups for the soup desert was just kheer and gulab  garlic naan is included which is nice  the rice was just plain basmati rice and it was a bit under cooked the chai tea is also includedone nice thing was in the condiments section there was indian hot sauce overall another decent addition to the indian food landscape of the area but nothing too special at least for their buffet,2.0,2,909 E Elliot Rd Tempe AZ 85284
Swagat India,delicious and fast! this lunch buffet left little to be desiredthere were two soups a tossed salad with several dressings including yogurt rice and something that tasted just like tzaziki sauce lots of chutneys; pickle onion mango and tomato to name a fewall of the vegetarian items were scrumptious and ill be darned if i can remember exactly what they had spinach and chickpeas and some curry potato zucchini dish also rice with vegetables and plain basmati rice with which to soak up the curried yummnessa co-worker gave her thumbs down to their tandoori chicken but youll have to try for yourself its well worth the adventure at only $839 with tax!,4.0,1,707 N Highpoint Rd Wexford Madison WI 53774
India Palace,until around a year ago this was the best indian restaurant in las vegas and remains a favorite  on our most recent visit we ordered naan basmati rice chicken tika marsala and rata lamb  we received naan basmati rice chicken tika marsala and rata chicken not a problem because we have never had rata chicken or rata lamb or rata anything for that matter each entre was both flavorful and spicy  service remains attentive so diamond palace in diamond bar ca had the best chicken tikka masala as of yet  well i have finally discovered (so far) the winner of that title  it now belongs to india palace in las vegas nv!  it is located a mile east of the strip  the neighborhood seems run-down but the restaurant is beautfully decorated and modern-looking  the flavours of the chicken tikka masala were perfect  i ordered mine spicy and it had just the right amount of kick  it was unanimous within our group of indian food-lovers that this was the best place weve had yet  the waiter recommended the rice dish pea pulao which contained white basmati rice peas yellow raisins and either peanuts or cashews (cant remember)  he said it was more special and flavorful than the regular rice  it was good also but i prefer the plain rice  the naan was perfect as well (but who could mess that up?)  i am sad that it is so far away because i cant eat it often but luckily i visit las vegas a few times a year and it will make it that much more special to anticipate eating it  i will never hit the casino buffets anymore and opt to go to india palaces buffet instead! now thats money well-spent!! i had a hankering for indian food and had been meaning to try india palace i grabbed a friend and we headed on our way as others have said the neighborhood is a bit sketchy the restaurant is nice inside and looks recently renovated the staff was extremely friendly and seated us right away the food is good really good they immediately brought us papadum and a few various sauces we ordered some garlic naan (delicious) and the bombay fish (decent)we ordered chicken tikka masala and reshami chicken along with two orders of basmati rice i ordered the tikka masala as spicy as they make it it was spicy but i wanted tears and didnt get any it was still delicious its the best indian food ive had in las vegas during the 5 years ive lived heregreat service great atmosphere and great food go! this review is for their lunch buffeti was so lucky today  the buffet had my favorite entree and dessert all for about $10 which normally would have cost me close to $20 easily  -goat karahi:  the meat was so tender and flavorful place a piece of this delicate meat on a piece of naan add some white onions and a squeeze of lemonwhat do you get?  yummy yummy in my tummy!-kheer: traditional rice pudding made with basmati rice milk sugar & saffron  i can eat 2 bowls of this easily  so deliciousthey constantly bring out naan to you when your basket gets lowaside from these 2 awesome things that i eat from the buffet line they also offer other dishes like the pakora aloo gobi chicken tandoori and many other dishes and desserts (my friend had mango custard and she said it was very goodi vowed to try it next time by not overstuffing myself with the kheer)  their menu changes though  the other time that i was here instead of the goat karahi they had lamb vindaloo  instead of kheer they had gulab jamun (milk cheese balls soaked in a honey syrup) which was a sad day for me :(  i expressed to the server with a pout indicating that i would much prefer the kheer  next thing you know he brought out a serving of kheer just for me!  yay to the awesome server!therefore if there are certain items that you like you might want to call ahead to check out whats on their line  other than that if you feel adventurous please check this place out i will definitely come back! since our last visit approximately 3 years ago the restaurant has undergone a complete makeover so the dining room is quite nice though the immediate area surrounding the restaurant remains depressed  we did not require our reservation as the dining room was empty  shortly after being seated we were served complimentary papadum and 3 chutney/sauces  we decided to share orders of garlic naan chicken tika masala basmati rice and lamb sagwala  the flavor and spice level of each dish proved to be too tame for my taste buds id give this more of a 35  its las vegas so i guess you should expect to pay las vegas prices  ive had dosas in california and in asia and would give this a 7/10 for flavor (thats why we came to this restaurant- for the paper dosas  we also had the malai kofta and that was better: 8/10  naan was solid and so was the basmati rice  service was great! ive been all around the world eating indian food especially dosas their dosas are mediocre theyre supposed to have a crunch to them however theirs came collapsed and slightly cold the malai kofta we ordered was a touch bland now the tragedythey charge $4 for a small bowel of basmati rice ive never heard of ordering curry without a serving of rice what a rip off so bottomline is that you get mediocre food for a terrible price i would not go back our favorite indian food in las vegas - near the strip and unlv campus sure its kind of in a sketch area but the building is nice - and once inside the decor and food are just great they play bollywood movies or clips on the tvs and its fun to watch while waiting for our food tonight our party of 4 was really hungry so we ordered our staples: vegetable samosas (2 for $450) garlic naan basmati rice matar paneer ($1295); and 3 dishes we havent had before: house special lamb rogan josh ($1595) full tandoori chicken ($20) and chicken vindaloo ($1495) were wimps so everything was mild spicy but still very flavorful and delicious with plenty of leftovers to take home i like to try different things on the menu each time were here but would definitely order the lamb dish again - fantastic flavor and tender!! i only wish i had room for dessert when i eat here! i always come here with a coupon to make the meal an even better deal (ended up being $21/person including tax) and the waiter always have to be reminded to take the discount but ive always had good attentive service and great food here and thats why we keep coming back! i stopped today to try the lunch buffet  what a great idea it was and thanks to my fellow yelpers for their reviews that helped me make my decisionthe restaurant was almost empty when i arrived at 12:30  service was excellent and i know it would have been even if there were a lot of people therewhile i was looking the buffet over the waiter brought me an iced tea as requested  shortly after returning to the table another server brought me a basket of fresh naanheres what i tried:vegetable pakora - good but not a lot of spicegoat curry - nice spice and very tastysaag paneer with cheese - flavorful with a nice zingbasmati rice - standardnaan - plain and goodchana masala - excellent with a nice spicinessbhindi masala - this was noted as a house favorite  i didnt think there was anything special about the okra nor the potatoes and it lacked much flavornavratan lorna - goodkarahi lamb - nice flavor and good spicechicken tikka masala - excellentras malai - excellent sweet to end this feastlest you worry that i cleaned the place out let me assure you i didnt  i took small portions of all these things just to try them  since i was alone i had a great time watching the bollywood bang-bang music videos on their tv screens  im anxious to come back for a relaxed dinner with friends and enjoy being served and trying some things on the evening menu that dont show on the buffet four people table service; two who really know and love indian food and two who love *this* place (though i am unsure of the breadth of knowledge on the cuisine itself) service:the service was fantastic vick really took care of us and having waited on my friends for the past four years exuded a certain cameraderie that really brought everyone together he made recommendations made sure we wanted for nothing and kept the meal moving forward without making us feel rushed in any wayfood:the food was mostly good not great but good tasty enough to share amongst friends over a couple bottles of wine and some good conversationthe paneer pakora (cheese squares made of 2 layers of cheese with some thin herb/veggie spread in between then battered and fried) was disappointing maybe the squares are too big and cool off too fast; it quickly becomes a hunk of room-temperature fried cheese it didnt make think of indian food as much as any other fried cheese product around townthe chicken pakora was much like the cheese; it seemed like any other fried chicken strip the flavors want to be there but its just not executed well enough not impressedthe samosas were really tasty the crusts were flaky and the stuffing was generous and flavorful layered flavors a great kick of spice and the textures were good a highlight for surethe sauces (mint tamarind and chili) were fantastic! really really flavorful and fresh we refilled our sauce dishes at least twice best part of the mealthe chicken tikka masala was tasty not the best in town but tasty we ordered one medium and one hot the hot was truly hot pushing the line of too much (and therefore hiding some of the flavors) still the flavors were good and the chicken was tender the peas pulao (basmati rice with peas and cashews) was pretty damn good actually i tasted a bite with a little of everything and really loved the freshness the combination of flavors great complementthe breads were good (my companions had to try at least four kinds?) i tasted a few small bits here and there and found them good again not great but good worth tryingcost/value:the apps and bread are priced well especially for groups who want to get a few things and share the entrees however are overpriced for what we received: appetizer size at entree prices the tikka masala was tiny for what they charge and the rice was a la carte (also a bit pricey for what you get) bad juju there as your entree becomes a $20+ dish but its just not a $20+ place it wasnt my dime but $200 for a group of four is a bit excessive for a place like this even considering the wineoverall: food (and value of same) made me think it was a 2-25 (edible but i have had much better) but the service and atmosphere was easily a 45! so a 3-star a-ok experience i *would* go again with my friends as they have a special affinity for this place but ill also take them somewhere else when its my turn to choose ive been coming here for the last 10 years and i have yet to have disappointing food or service  i agree the service can border on being overly attentive at times  everybody is warm and friendly and eager to have you as a guest  i can heartily recommend india palace to both vegetarians and carnivores alike  ive visited with a large group of vegetarians and there were nothing but compliments  so now the food:the thing to start with especially with a group is the assorted naan breads  my favorites include keema which is naan with minced lamb garlic and poori which is fried whole wheat bread  the naan rounds out what seem to some as small portions  when you have naan your entree of choice with the aromatic basmati rice you have a very generous serving of foodno matter what you order i recommend getting rice as a nice complement to the sauces and curries  im not a vegetarian but enjoy the spices of the channa (chickpeas) masala  the goat saag in spinach and herb is delicious  the meat is so tender and juicy it can best most steaks  i can say that about the chicken and lamb as wellto top it off india palace serves a great selection of beers from india including hayward 5000 taj mahal and king fisher  i find taj mahal the most refreshing almost sweet tasting and it goes well if you like your food spicybottom line: very attentive service delicious variety very tender very juicy meats and indian beer  you can tell the ingredients are high quality and worth the upscale price wellon a whim my friends and i were looking for a good place to eat and someone suggested india palace having heard the good reviews over the years we decided to give it a try i checked the yelp app on my phone and saw that with check-in on the app you get 1 free appetizer or cocktail with purchase the reviews were also favorable so in we went we arrived at 5pm and the place was seemingly in between shifts so we were sat promptly i noticed on signage that there were happy hour specials until 6pm so i asked the hostess about them she replied happy hour? why not?  you can get buy 1 get one free on appetizers  great it was about the same as the deal on the app so we ordered we had veggie and lamb samosas very nice as well as a few other items including garlic naan bread chicken briyani (chicken mixed with basmati rice with spices cashews & vegetables) and chicken tikka masala (tandoori white chicken marinated in yogurt & spices simmered in a creamy tomato sauce) pretty standard stuff we even opted for some traditional desserts and indian beerall in all the food was really good and tasty and i was very satisfied and full service was a bit off but i think that may have been due to the language barrier and sometimes the server would suggest an item and then bring something else in this case he offered a couple of different beers and then brought something altogether different it wasnt a huge deal as the beers were good and 3 of us were sharing so they went fastwhat was strange was when the bill arrived i asked again about the happy hour specials as the bill had not been adjusted our server was no where to be found and the server presenting the check had no idea what i was talking about i got up to ask the hostess that seated us about the specials (she was the one that said why not) and she acted as though she didnt know what i was talking about then reluctantly adjusted the bill the new server brought over the adjusted bill and seemed pretty aggravated at me possibly for asking about the discount? i dont know but it was not a happy presentation of the new check we paid and left i would go again possibly for a buffet situation as i wasnt completely satisfied with the service but the food was very good i think at least one of my friends wouldnt return due to the service we werent asking much but the hasty and unhappy presentation of out adjusted bill kind of put us off a bit like i said though we liked the food so who knows :)you should know that india palace is on a very sketchy part of twain ave it is literally always surrounded by police cars and as we pulled into the parking lot of the restaurant no less than 4 police cars with sirens blaring were pulling 3 guys out of a car next door and had them pinned to the ground at gunpoint i mention it because i know the neighborhood well and this has to be one of the less savory sections i just wouldnt want a tourist to stop in and be surprised but commotions such as an arrest at gunpoint in a connecting parking lothappy eating! having just moved to vegas and missing my favourite indian restaurant back home we gave india palace a try using  a restaurantscom  couponwe started with appetizer plate - 5 appetizers of your choice  i had a lichi martini and my hubby ordered the beer recommended by our waiter  everything was awesome! we then ordered lamb rogan josh and goat curry basmati rice and garlic naanit was all sooooo good!  very fresh very flavourful  nice clean restaurant with lovely atmosphere and wonderful wait staff  waiter then directed us to yelp for the coupon herecant wait for my next craving! this is my first foray into indian cooking here in las vegas so i have to say im very impressed with the scope of the menu as with the freshness and flavors of the dishesservice was alright not particularly friendly but efficient none the less though there was an older woman bringing out the dishes she was amazing! i think she may have been one of the owners just amazingly warm and friendly wish she was our server the whole timethe tvs and sound system were playing bollywood music videos which was pretty fun! they do have a full bar! oh and be sure to check in we got a free mango lassi on to the disheschicken tikka - moist fragrant flavorful and oh so tender!chicken tikka masala - big bold flavors creamy and again insanely tendermalai kofta - similar to the chicken masala though not as spicy balls of cheese and vegetable sitting in a thick creamy gravy garlic naan - lightly crisp with a nice chew this complimented our dishes with the ability to scoop up the amazing sauces basmati rice - another amazing vehicle for the more gravy laden dishes well be back! excellent food  i got the tandoori chicken with the medium spiciness which was perfect  the chicken was perfectly cooked and the flavor was really really mouthwatering good  i also got the basmati rice which was perfect as well the cheese naan was worth it as well very soft and fresh with great flavor  i love the mint sauce that came along with it and the brown sauce was excellent as well  i will come back the next time im in vegas for business i ate a bunch of high-end high-rated food in the resorts while i was here and this is what stood out the most  im partial to this kind of stuff though but ultimately id love to try many other things on their menu after the awesome flavor and great quality of the food i had here this evening after watching the movie life of pi on blu-ray i was craving for indian food found this place thanks to groupon my friend and i decided to hit up this place after she was done drunk shopping at fashion show mall lolcame around 6 for dinner right after we sat down there was an influx of customers for dinner whew got the orders in and didnt have to wait long ordered the following:appetizer combo - samosa aloo tikki veggie chicken and paneer pakora this was the first plate that came out duh its an appetizer its pretty decent and sharing it with two people is good enoughi enjoyed the samosa and the paneer pakora the most chicken tikka masala and fish tikka masala with plain basmati rice ok so the entree is where my heart somewhat melts got them both at medium spicy it was too much gravy-yyy and not enough meat meat - gravy ratio: 1:3 bottom line i would hit up this place again but would try the lunch buffet we purchased a living social deal $15 for $30 credit on a recent trip to vegas-- i gotta say i would definitely go back even without the deal pros: the food reasonably priced these were more than enough for two people (we had leftovers & ordered extra naan for later)lamb rogan josh $1595 plain basmati rice $395chicken tikka masala $1495garlic naan $295their free mango drink when you check in is soooo goood cons: nothing really just the service was a little slow they had a private party going on in another room but our server garry was great!basically worth checking out bomb indian food entertaining music videos on tv friendly staff it was a very hectic time of the year i was packing my room was a mess uncertainty on my employment and i am about to transfer to san francisco it was another bored afternoon after an early day at work i was driving around hunting for food and i realized this little hidden treasure within a small strip mall the strip mall looks kinda run-down a bit but once you enter the premise you are greeted by a delicate aroma of curry and spiciness in the airso i decided to patron this restaurant for a heavy buffet lunch i wasnt expecting much especially there aint much good indian cuisine here in arizona i went to the buffet lane :p and the first item was 2 choice of rice regular basmati rice or bryani rice which is very rare that they offer 2 type of rice for buffet next there are plenty of choices of daal and vegetable curry the cauliflower and potato masala was great then the typical serving of chicken tandoori and chicken masala to my delight they actually serve lamb curry which is very rare for indian lunch buffetthe flavor was decent for a buffet lunch but it seems like a great deal for a lunch they serve as usual i stuffed myself with 2 full plates of masala and rice then end with a plate of lamb curry and chicken masala with the naan that they served with the lunchtoo bad that i have just relocated myself to the bay area about 4 days ago if not i will surely return to the restaurant to fulfill my craving for indian serving and masala fellow yelpian ryan c organized a little luncheon at india palace yesterday (see its not only ladies who lunch sometimes its us manly men too:)i made the pilgrimage from otowsco to the near reaches of nw phx and met up with ryan rand norm daren and wes and we talked and laughed and we hit the boofay at india palace pretty hard:)pretty good boofaynot terribly extensive as far as the food selections gobut the available items were all well prepared well seasoned and my lunch ended up on the happy end of the crap to quality ratio:)as we dug into our first plate of boofay ryan said i hope everybody filled up on bananas and cheesea humorous comment about lubricative effects of the food at india palace:)in a happy coincidence he almost exactly described my breakfast yesterday morning4 bananas and a  1/2 pound of tillamook sharp cheddar:)when you get to be my age the adage never trust a fart after 50 isnt just a funny thing to sayit becomes one of the guiding principles in your lifeso bananas and cheeseall the currys and tandooris  and vegetarian squash/potato stuff and vindaloos with basmati rice and naan in the joint arent going to break through this particular firewall:-)oatmeal would have just been throwing gas (nogasoline not gi tract methane) on the fire (oh waitthat would work too:)although im not generally a fan of boofays (i really do think the sneeze guards seem to be just a suggestion to many of the people that i see rooting around in the boofay) this was a pretty clean and well maintained boofayi had 2 plates of pretty decent indian food and got a chance to relax for few minutes with friends and have a little light conversation:)things stayed sealed up tight and i sailed through the rest of my day with the confidence dignity and demeanor of a man who knows that everything is safely locked down:),3.789473684210526,19,2941 W Bell Rd Phoenix AZ 85053
Bollywood Grill Indian Cusine,i was craving indian cuisine and came in for a late dinner the place is decorated like a bollywood movie scene and the large flat screen was playing bhangra style music videos got a little nervous that there were no patrons other than myself and i almost left im soooo glad that i stayed my husband and i ordered one of the prix fixe meals the director cut for 2999 (the most expensive meal on the menu) there were 3 appetizers 3 entrees and all you can eat basmati rice and naan the food was great! i am familiar with norther indian cooking and didnt order any southern style the portions looked small when they came to the table but there was really way too much and i had to take the rest home the chef even threw in extra naan again the food was flavorful and well presented the waiter explained each dish and its ingredients which i was thankful for the surprise hit was the baingan bartha which is an egg plant dish the only reason i didnt rate bollywood with 5 stars; the dessert was rice with milk and sugar (i really think they could have done better) and we were not offered any tea after our meal (the prix fixe comes with tea or coffee) i had the kingfisher beer it came in a 22oz bottle for 599 and tastes a lot like a new castle i will definitely be returning!,4.0,1,6840 W Sahara Ave Westside Las Vegas NV 89146
NASHA Indian Cuisine,wednesday night dinner with the wife chicken vindaloo with basmati rice and naan mmmmm delicious! best in town and the hot chai tea is a perfect compliment to the spicy vindaloo,5.0,1,2051 W Warner Rd Ste 7 Chandler AZ 85224
Mayuri Palace,traveled a bit to get here but wanted to give this place a chance  what a great idea that was!!!  chicken vindaloo basmati rice and chicken biryani--- all delicious and cooked to order as we requested  the portions were generous as well  food was not greasy and most flavorful  we like spicy dishes and we got them  most places are afraid of making them spicy when you request it  this is not to say that people who are cautious of spiciness cant get what they want  the service was friendly and attentive  i cant complain about a thing  btw i dont rate on decor so people who dont like their decor arent into really good serious indian food  this was really really good indian food priced lower than most indian restaurants  the basmati rice was included with the entree while most indian restaurants dont  other restaurants make you order rice separately to jack up the bill   i am definitely going back to enjoy what was probably the best indian food in a long time the last time i was here was in december  i thought the food was spectacular  today three months later not so much  had the chicken biryani and the shrimp sag  asked for the sag (spinach) to be made without dairy  there is another local restaurant that does this for me  well they accommodated my request but the dish turned out to be flavorless  i didnt ask for the spices to be left out--just the dairy  so the shrimp sag was so so and this is being generous  the basmati rice that came with the shrimp sag lacked salt in its totality so it just tasted like white mush  the chicken biryani was generous and had three pieces of chicken which was enough  however it was not tasty like the last time--again lacking in spices  everything was freshly made that has to be said  the waitress gave us some raita (yogurt) and let us sample the sambar?when we inquired about what the buffet was like (before we got our food)   it was lentils in a tomato base  really good  the waitress was very polite attentive and just an overall nice young lady  i am so disappointed in the food this time around though  i know this cannot be the same chef who made our food the last time  the bad thing about the restaurant business is the movement of chefs and staff  here today gone tomorrow  today was a case where the former chef was greatly missed by us  i dont think i would make another trip out to 24th avenue and bell to eat this indian food  i thought i had found a gem but sadly this is not the case management:  work on your food who was cooking in december that made my first visit so great??? wednesday night around 8pmquiet 3 other tablessmells good place is a little shoddy with ripped vinyl seatsits ok i go for the foodpros:vegetable samosa to start goodi had the chicken chetti nadu  delicious spicy great authentic flavors chunks of chicken lots of hot peppers in the dish which i normally eat but the spice was pretty hot so i refrained or would have scorched my taste buds and not tasted anything else for a day or sobasmati rice goodplain naan awesome!!cons:husband had chicken vindaloo not good dont add crushed red pepper flakes that you sprinkle on pizza to make it spicy either you make a vindaloo sauce or you dont this was more like marinara sauce with tons of hot pepper flakes thats not vindaloo  although we may appear as vanilla americans we are well internationally traveled and foodies been cooking indian food for 21 years small portions for the moneyi see raves about the buffet and i would try this place againgood luck everyone!,3.3333333333333335,3,2410 W Bell Rd Phoenix AZ 85023
Mantra Masala,a quiet nicely decorated indian restaurant in the southwest area of town  we were the only diners on a sunday night (which usually isnt a good thing) but they are hidden awaythe husband and i shared:* lamb biryani baked casserole of basmati rice and lamb richly flavored with saffron ($1695) - the husband has a special liking to biryani and immediately looked through the menu for this item  he ordered it spicy and definitely enjoyed it more so with the leftovers the next day* malai kofta mixed vegetable dumplings in savory creamy spiced sauce ($1295) - im all about any kind of creamy sauce and there are very few i dont like in indian cuisine  their version was super tasty and really good with the garlic nan bread  yum!  i chose medium for my spice  it also came with rice  the dumplings were just okay though* garlic nan leavened bread baked with fresh chopped garlic in the tandoor ($295) - when going nan garlic is the only way to go  so good i could only wish for moreoverall the food was pretty good  our waiter was definitely attentive until he got stuck on the phone with a to go order  it is rather expensive for the two entrees and condiment we ordered even with an entertainment book coupon  wed consider going again but definitely know why the indian lunch buffets do so well in the city in a word: yummy! indian food tends toward the expensive side so i appreciate mantra masalas lunch special menu i went with lunch two featuring chicken tikka masala it comes with a side of dewane handi (spinach puree with assorted vegetables) some seasoned basmati rice and a decently sized piece of naanto be real its not a whole lot of food for $795 + tax but mantra preaches healthy food with that in mind its a good portion and definitely satiated my appetite without making me overly full and most importantly everything was delicious i prefer the flavor of mantras chicken tikka masala over mint indian bistros the naan was cooked perfectly and the dewane handi was surprisingly good (ive never had it before)i havent eaten dinner at mantra looking at the dinner menu prices i probably wouldnt want to for lunch however it presents a nice option it is a bit far from work but its a quick zip up the 215 ill definitely get lunch there again some daynote: a sign outside advertizes lunch specials under $6 this is misleading one lunch dish is $595 the rest are $795 or higher35 stars very good! went for some buffalo wild wings but instead i ended up having some indian cuisine service was very good! the way to go is chicken curry basmati rice and garlic bread right out of the oven nice small place cant go wrong with the chicken tikka masala basmati rice and naan ordered take out for 8 people - the staff was friendly the owner helped me load my car and was expecially helpful when i asked for plates/utinsels/napkins overall very friendly and good food id certainly return! i was craving indian food and this place was close by the office so i thought to give it a try though a co-worker had a less than positive experience on her visit i had the lunch special #2 (chicken tikka and spinach puree with legumes) and ordered to-go the online menu states that soup is included in the lunch special but when i asked about it they said not for to-go orders that stipulation was not stated on their website the person who took my order seemed a tad bit confused and did not really understand what i was sayingwhen i went to pick up my food was waiting in a locker-type container and wasnt that hot i opened the styrofoam box to find half a piece of naan as a fan of indian cuisine i was most looking forward to this part of the meal the naan was thin and simply ok the portion was a bit small for $1000; only 3 pieces of chicken and about a table spoon of veggies the basmati rice lacked in flavor and disappointed as one of my favorite parts to indian cuisineall in all it satisfied my instant craving for indian food but would not go again due to the portion size and lack of flavor it was the epitome of the 2 star rating: meh ive experienced better,3.2,5,8530 W Warm Springs Rd Ste 101 Southwest Las Vegas NV 89113
Samosa Factory,im from central new jersey otherwise known as mumbai west where authentic indian restaurants are three-deep in every single strip mall  indian food is my favorite ethnic cuisine so i know good indian when i eat it  and samosa factory is that good!this was our first visit and its now our new favorite vegas indian restaurant  the food was terrific the service outstanding and the waitress katie was friendly helpful and attentive  just as important we were made to feel welcome by her as well as by the ownerwe started with veggie samosas  i love them but dont often order them because theyre usually heavy and greasy  not here  the pastry covering was light and flaky the filling was fresh and delicious and it was one helluva stuffed samosa  the accompanying coriander sauce was the best ive ever had and the chutney had a deliciously different tastewe had chicken tikka which was cut in bite-sized pieces and mixed with green and yellow peppers onions and an assortment of flavorful spices  the dish was brimming with flavor and happily it didnt have the overwhelming heaviness that i always dread at indian restaurants  my nit with this dish is that we were sharing it so presenting it on a small flat plate made it a bit difficult to transfer to our own plates we also shared a chicken & spinach curry  i hesitated before ordering it expecting the spinach to be drowning in cream and ghee  it wasnt  and the cubes of chicken were the most tender ive ever hadthe onion nan had an abundance of onion and again was lighter and less greasy than i expected  we also ordered a side of raita  i was intrigued by the description which said that the yogurt was mixed with granny smith apple  hmm different  and it was; the apple added a slight sweetness and was the perfect complement to the tanginess of the yogurt  it was the outstanding accompaniment for the chicken tikka  the mango lassi was great too  (be aware that the restaurant has no liquor license  but if you must drink you can get sloshed before or after at pts pub a few doors down  i suspect kristin b did just that before writing her ridiculous non-review)the entrees were served with rice; the menu had the word pilaf blacked out and the rice was plain white rice  this was a first for me and it didnt make me ecstatic:  i missed the grilled onion and great flavor that a good rice pilaf - with basmati rice - should have  but this is a small price to pay for a wonderful dinner that will otherwise please your palate and not make you feel as if your fat and calorie quota has exceeded the national debt  all in all this was a memorable meal and one that we look forward to repeating very soon ive been to several of the more popular indian restaurants in vegas and this is by far my favourite!  samosas are always fresh and flavourful with a nice mix of subtle spices that is well-complimented by a selection of chutneys!  hot crispy perfection!  the lamb korma is pure curry heaven too  the boneless lamb is always tender and super-tasty with creamy sauce over fresh garlic naan and aromatic basmati rice  is your mouth watering yet?  then get off the internet and into your car  head down to samosa factory for the best indian food vegas has to offer right now!!  :-) disappointing i really wanted to like this place it is the sorta divey feel i like in eateries but the food was just not very good i ordered the samosa chaat and it could have been a great dish except at the last second the chef decided to add black pepper to the top a lot of it the basmati rice was salty and over cooked the paneer was a soggy mess with a weird texture and woeful lack of spice the tandoori chicken and garlic naan were yummy (thats why it gets 2 stars) but overall the food was not worth the cost yelp you disappointed me tonight you know if the restaurant is run by people whose ethnic background does not match the food something is bound to go wrong (sorry just a stereotype of mine i cannot break)anyways we decided on indian for dinner tonight and i suggested to try samosa factory as i had bookmarked this place for quite some time the restaurant had mostly positive reviews which is what convinced me to stray from our usual indian jointthe restaurant itself is small definitely a hole in the wall type of place  we were greeted by this a large caucasian man definitely not what i was expecting at an indian restaurant  not sure if he was the owner but in addition to seating us he took our order and served us our mealwe order the chicken tikka masala shrimp vindaloo and garlic naan  both entrees served with basmati ricethe chicken tikka masala was not what we were expecting  prepared completely different from any other indian restaurant weve ever tried  i was expecting yummy curry sauce but this hardly had any  although it wasnt badly prepared it just wasnt up to our liking  the shrimp vindaloo was nothing spectacular either  this had more curry sauce than the chicken tikka masala but nothing impressive  i like curry sauce to be thick this was more watery  lastly the garlic naan and basmati rice were just average  i didnt care of the naan because it was thin and dry as opposed to thick and fluffy like how we are used to having at mt everestsigghh what a disappointing meal  sorry to say we wont be coming back,3.25,4,4604 W Sahara Ave Ste 6 Westside Las Vegas NV 89102
Bombay Spice Grill,do not come here if you want indian cuisine! i should have read other reviews more closely  do i really want hummus or ceviche at an indian restaurant? this place is more for wine and tapas  the decor is very hip and trendy but i dine out for the food and i thought the food was bland and tasteless  entrees were high at $14 each plate and comes 2 dishes served with rice and chapati bread (wheat tortilla)food arrived not hotmy friend had vegetarian curry; veggies had that frozen food rubbery texture cumin potatoes were sour  my chicken keema and chicken tikka masala was bland and niether dish had flavor  my basmati rice was clumpy and sticky :(i did not like the ginger green tea it tasted like licorice i dunno maybe im too harsh and narrow minded  i did feel underwhelmed and disappointed the food is not amazing i loved the idea of choosing from a variety of indian sauces to create your own dish with meat and veggies of your choice! we had lamb chick peas and broccoli in the korma sauce on top of basmati rice and washed it down with iced indian tea yum! the only disappointment was the gajar ka halwa which isnt the same without ghee great food reasonably priced and large portions i like the wide assortment of grilled veggies as well as the addition of tofu as a protein option choose a base (quinoa brown or basmati rice) a protein (beef chicken tofu) choose your veggies and a sauce -- or as i like to do it a blend of sauces having brought multiple friends here as first timers i have gotten nothing but excellent responses from them i appreciate the vegetarian and vegan options and my friends enjoy the beef and chicken options everything has been tasty tasty tasty!i was a fan of the old bombay and continue to be a fan - probably because i come for the food not the atmosphere while hesitant about the change at first i now enjoy the flexibility that this style of restaurant provides for those who only came when it first opened some things have changed - including the assortment of available vegetables as a vegan diner i was a little concerned about my options however i think theyve done a good job of adapting to a changing market as well as the input of their loyal customers now if i could just get them to bring the korma sauce back : ) we never went to shea and this is our first visit here i was surprised it is like a fast food place i am kind of naive that way : pso ordering and getting your food seems to be fast and the employees were very helpful and friendly i had a coupon and they were very patient explaining the terms to mewe got 2 bowls one drink one naan and one order of the crispy chip like stuff (pappadum?) total was $21food itself is like 3 stars i was not that crazy about it but i bumped it to 4 for these reasons:*service was good*they had the following options: basmati rice brown rice and quinoa (kudos for the quinoa)*aaaaand the vindaloo sauce is in fact hot/spicy which is a great thing for us*tamarind chutney was delicious,3.5,4,4720 E Cactus Rd Ste D118 Phoenix AZ 85032
Mint Indian Bistro,this restaurant  in a small shopping plaza features the cuisine of both india and nepal  we shared traditional nepalese entrees of chili chicken and meat momo as recommended by max jacobsen  the waiter asked how spicy would we like our chili chicken - indian spicy was my reply  wow - call the fire department - we are talking smoking hot!  each order of meat momo order includes 9 momos (i love that word) which are steamed dumplings stuffed with ground turkey and vegetables  we also ordered naan 2 mango lassis (yogurt based beverages) and 2 desserts (khir and lal mohan) the former is basmati rice in milk with raisins and nuts and the latter is similar to or the same as gulab jamun but a bit denser i went here a few days ago because its like 2 miles away from my house this place has been a few different restaurants in the few years ive lived on this side of town it was a himalayan restaurant and now its indian restaurant the decor inside is very basic moss green walls some black iron pieces on the walls but was largely devoid of cultural ambiance that i particularly like in ethnic restaurants i feel like decor really adds to an experience it makes it feel authentic this place didnt really have that it was new so maybe thats why it was so sparsely decorated i took someone here because they never tried indian before so we just ordered the indian sampler the indian sampler had about pint sized versions of coconut curry vegetables lamb vindaloo chicken masala lentils tandoori chicken yoghurt kheer and one other that i cant remember it was accompanied by 2 pieces of sliced garlic naan and basmati rice the coconut curry veggies were fantastic the flavors were excellent the lamb vindaloo was good not great not as spicy as im used to but not bad the tandoori chicken was kind of a joke  it looked like two cornish game hen legs so micro chicken legs i thought that looked horrible  we ordered lychee lassi and mango lassi and for whatever reason i was served lukewarm mango lassi ive never received lassi that wasnt cold so it was a little different for me since the lychee lassi was served over ice the service was good no complaints on that the owner chatted with us a little and was friendly all in all it was okay it wasnt great the price points are lower than origin india so id go back if i wanted to pay something a little more moderate the experience was fun nothing mind blowing origin india just blows it out of the water as far as the quality of the food and ambiance though so id much rather go there if i had a choice theres a lot of haters but it seems their issues stem from the lunch buffet of which we did not partake i went for a night out with my boyfriend and we opted for the indian sampler our server was also one of the lucky owners an extremely cordial and friendly man who recommended some delicious beers its obvious that hes a man who takes his libations seriously which we appreciated he explained that during the time of day we were there he opted to maintain the restaurant himself aside from showcasing an impressive work ethic it allows him to interact with his customers and gain insight on their reactions and feelings he takes an active interest in the reviews and responses of individuals and mentioned that he periodically updates this page himself :} so hi! thanks for the meal! we started with the don de dieu a canadian beer with a high alcohol percentage while still being light floral fruity and crisp it was a nice beverage to sample while awaiting our food and taking in the environment the interior is a pleasant cool green shade with dark wood tones on the tables floor and chairs that we found very soothing and appealing there are several pieces of art on the walls as well as iron work the bar is well stocked and there is a window that lets you peak into the kitchen gently wafting in the background was atmosphere music not too obtrusive but a pleasant additionthe first food that was brought to us were flat breads that were studded with cumin/coriander seeds they were folded over themselves and super thin with a light crunch and pleasant mouthfeel they were served with a mint and tamarind chutney the tamarind was sweet and tangy but the mint was cool and savory i vastly preferred the mint but we enjoyed both we were given a refill of the bread and sauces prior to our meal the sampler itself was brought out on a large metal tray with each dish presented in a small metal container initially it looked like it may not be that much food but as we began to ate we realized that the 9 small containers were  easily enough to feed 3 maybe even 4 light eaters with a refill of rice we were extremely satisfied the meal included; - fresh baked garlic naan : hearty flat breads with fresh herbs and garlic studded throughout served at the center of the platter and ideal for dunking into residual sauces/soup- vegetable pakodas : crispy deep fried bites of mixed vegetables excellent dipped into the tangy and rich homemade whole-milk yogurt and a dollop of ghost chili sauce- chicken tikka masala : creamy with hearty chunks of chicken in a sauce that gradually ramps up the heat in your mouth after a few bites it gains an addictive spice - lamb vindaloo : like a stew with a spice and sweetness differentiating it from the usual western stew i particularly enjoyed this and would look forward to ordering it again - organic tandoori chicken : tender flavorful chicken with a yummy spice rub coating the outside giving it a bright reddish-pink tinge there were two peices and they were a little small so this would be the only downside to ordering the platter for more than 2 people they  may be willing to adjust the serving for a larger party if you ask as they seem quite amicable :}- mixed vegetable curry of the day : ours had lots of zucchini chickpeas tomatoes and a rich sauce i probably wouldnt order this by itself but thats simply because i dug the other vegetable based dish so much more - chefs choice lentil soup : this was delicious! it had a strong turmeric flavor and color and was very flavorful the lentils werent very chunky so the soup itself was not exceedingly thick i enjoyed the consistency personally- fresh homemade whole-milk yogurt : one of my other favorite options it was extremely creamy with a rich tang and was an instant relief from some of the strongly flavored dishes a great way to cleanse your palate between dishes or dolloped on top of them - aromatic basmati rice : a chewier drier rice that easily soaked up much of the sauce from the dishes a good compliment as the texture of the rice really helped to enrich and fortify the thinner or lighter dishes- khir dessert : sweet rice pudding with what i thought may have been a hint of rosewater i ate most of it and really enjoyed it!while eating we enjoyed two other beers as well;yeti! an indian beer that had a hoppy smokey flavor it was more of a dry lager but went very very well with the food we really enjoyed it and asked our server about sourcing itwe ended with piraat a potent amber beer with an earthy tang and a hoppy afterbite also quite good but strong! i gave most of mine to the boy to finish so i could safely navigate our journey home i definitely intend to go back sometime for the lunch buffet and their other set menus its a great introduction to a new cultures cuisine in a  nice relaxed atmosphere with helpful and pleasant service that isas good as it getsin las vegas!!!!i have been coming here since i found it in its prior name himalayan restaurant  the first time i came here we used the coupon from restaurantcom  i had a hard time finding a good indo-pak restaurant so good thing there is restaurantcomfirst timeappetizerhimalayan samosas-potatoes and peas stuffed in a light fluffy pastry  butthe best thing about this is dipping it into the tamarind chutney  dang this is awesomechicken rebel curry-spicynot much else  i havent been ordering this  not memorable  lets move onlamb vindaloo-spicy and tons of flavor  the lamb was nice and tendergarlic naan-were not short of garlic  top that lamb vindaloo pieces with a shred of onion and dip it into the tamarind chutneywow!!mango lassi-is good as evermy friend said that coupon or no coupon we are coming back fo sho!!second timedidnt use a coupon so we were able to get:-indian sampler-3099--garlic naan--pakodas-dumpling kinda look with vegetable stuffed inside  the outside is a chickpea batter  this was dipped into a nutty sauceinteresting combination--chicken tikka marsala--lamb vindaloo--tandoori chicken-chicken was very juicy with a nice spice rub  --vegetable curry-for a vegetable curry this is so flavorful--yogurt (this was homemade it was super tarttoo tart for my taste)--basmati rice (i am used to the jasmine rice but this basmati is on a new playing field)--khir-dessert is this rice pudding (basmati rice! yay) in milk spiced with nuts and raisins  this is one of my favorite dessert  once again bursting with flavorsthis sampler was perfect  we got to tried out everything  recommend for adventurous newbies  they werent super spicy either so is easy on the tongue (and tummy) since there are so may other dish that one can alternate between the spicy onelamb vindaloothird time and so on:ghosht karahi (goat curry)-flavors remind me of back homeaahhhh i miss homeok focus!  so my routine comes to play  i ask for a side of onion and some lemon wedges  i mix the onion with the goat curry and squeeze lemon in it  its amazing how the onion would make the flavor even spicier and how the lemon juice brings out that tang!!!  now try this with the best naan that i have tasted yetthe naan with fruits in the middle  this is the only place that have it as far as i know  you get savory and sweet  have mango lassi with this entree is the perfect combination  of course i have the khir at the end of my every meal  service has always been super for me  the owners are sooooooo fantastic  they are so kind and wonderful  i love the decor  oh i forgot to mention they have a very extensive beer selection  my friends always order beer and try like three different kinds every time  i stick to my mango lassi and am happy with it i cant say enough good things about this place! id had their food back when they were called himalayan restaurant and it was very good my recent dinner visit was the first time i had actually been inside the restaurant and the first time id had the food since they came under new ownership the waiter was very helpful and friendly he suggested getting the vegan sampler when we informed him we wanted to try everything on the menu so we ordered the vegan sampler which was perfect for two people every item was amazing except for the carrot (i think) which was a little too sweet for my taste the sampler comes with two sides of basmati rice roti and six or seven other items the soup and chana saag were my favorites ill definitely be back to try the dosas! note for those with restaurantcom certificates:apparently they have a conflict with restaurantcom and arent accepting their coupons however they honored the discount themselves and told us to get a refund for our certificate and will probably do the same for others he looked upset a bit explaining it so its probably something ugly i thought it was cool that they will honor it themselves to help out the customers *********for years i ate indian food on a weekly basis and for a while i stayed away since i burned out and the bf never had indian food before so away we went  the drink selection is one main reason that made me really want to try them we are beer nerds so it makes for a lovely surprise that a unassuming bistro would have such an impressive drink menu the bf wasnt sure of what and our server (i think possibly the owner) asked what kinds of flavors he likes and gave a few recommendations i always appreciate a place that knows what they sell since it seems most people dont care about beer the way they do of wine the bf took his suggestion of a augustjn abbey ale ($7) and i had a troubadour obscura ($7) which the guy poured into tulips with care to produce a proper head! i had a nerd moment that they had the proper kind of glasses and someone cared about our drinks as much as we do he treated it like a sommelier would a fine wine while we waited for food we were served papadam with a tamarind chutney and a cilrantro mint chutney all really finely made for food we really couldnt decide to we went with a indian sampler ($30) it doesnt look like a lot of food but we were both comfortably fullit includes:*chicken tikka masala- this was a lovely tikka ive had a lot and this was one of the better ones ive had very robust but balanced the bf loved this and raves its the best curry hes had and he had a foodie moment (aww i think us yelpers are getting to himmaybe hell change his mind about doing reviews one day) *lamb vindaloo- the lamb was very tender and the sauce complimented it very well with a bit earthiness tangyness and a tad spicy *tandoori chicken- crisp and nicely spiced outside juicy inside*mixed veggie curry- had a good mix of cauliflower zucchini beans peppers the curry had a very light and fragrant flavor to iti cant quite place the spices but i liked this *chef choice of lentils- today it was daal i like daal since its earthy and comforting *we got yoghurt basmati rice and garlic naan as well the naan was pretty noms here *khir came with it for dessert its a rice and milk porridge with raisins nuts and cardamom according to the menu when i was eating it to me it tasted more flowery than just cardamom like possible orange blossom water was added its the kind of light dessert that would be amazing for a hot summer day since its served cold and has such bright flavorswe also ordered another dessert that i thought i had and loved at another restaurant and at friends house but havent come across it in a while turns out it was what i was looking for! lal mohan ($299) the description says its served cold but its served piping hot! its these round pastries that are fried so the outside is crisp and the inside has a creamy kind of dough they throw it into syrup and it absorbs it so it flavors it throughoutthey come 3 to a serving in a shot glass balls are about gumball sized so you dont get much of it but its quality its a comforting kind of dessert that would be a good for people who like fried mochi with honey warm donuts zeppolis beignets the service was friendly and helpful i like the little details that show they care like having proper beer glasses or giving us warm plates utensils were impeccably polished- no water marks at all it felt very comfortable with the warm decor and the good staff making you feel good about being there i just got a strong feeling that they are proud of this place in the pride they take for the little details i havent been this surprisingly satisfied in a long time the bf was super happy with discovering indian food and having a food epiphany of sorts about itdays later hes still telling me about the tikka and how he wants to go next weekend  definitely we will be coming back for a la carte and also the buffet sounds like a deal if our next experience is as good as this one it can quickly grow to be a favorite ive been here many times for dinner but not buffet  this review is for the lunch buffetthere were many items in the buffet line ranging from vegetarian to meat courses the quality and taste of the dishes exceed my expectations even more now  i love goat karahi  i have been to many indian restaurants where the goat karahi isnt consistent  i know i can count on mint to make sure that each piece is tender and flavorful  i mixed my tender chunks of goat meat with slices of onions and cucumbers then squeezed lemon on them and tossed it around some more it was delicious and the naan was great as well  however goat karahi wasnt the only star on todays menu (according to me of course)  i have tried tandoori chicken at many places but i find it lacks flavor  when debbie said that the tandoori chicken is her favorite i decided to grab a piece to give it a try  boy was i glad debbie raved about it  it was sooooo gooood!  i tore off a piece of this delicious chicken that bursted with flavor and put it on top of freshly baked garlic naan i then dipped it into the tamarind chutney and wala yummy-in-my-tummy  i was full at this point but still had to eat my favorite dessert khir  i was super excited to see this in the  buffet line  i love the basmati rice slow cooked in milk with a dash of cardamom  i got two servings one for roland and one for myself  somehow they both ended up being consumed by meoopskhiri cant help myselfi also had the lal mohan  again tried this at other places never liked it  luckily debbie also raved about this so i gave it a shotthank goodness i tried it because it is deliciousand the staff attentive and friendly as always another lunch for 1 please i went here on a tuesday for the $999 lunch buffet i got basmati rice: good garlic naan: good chicken tikka masala: cubed chicken breast was a bit on the dry side chicken tandori: flavorful chicken pakoda: basically battered fried chicken i cant remember the name of the noddles i had but they were vegetarian and super spicy all in all it was alright good variety of items with descriptions of what sauces they would go well with and if they were vegan/vegetarian mint indian bistro is an interesting spot its not like most indian places im used to a little more upscale a little more gourmet a little more well different my paradigm for indian food is in general that the best food comes from the dingiest places - so a proportionally inverse relationship between the fanciness of the decor and the quality of the food (from the standpoint of taste) when i walked in to mint i immediately formed an impression about what i was going to eat and i was not too surprised in the end just glad to have some decent indian food since i come from a place that has none the food at mint falls into the higher-end category - better meats obviously more hand-made sauces etc not as dirty earthy pungent and street as the style that really rocks my socks but its good nonetheless and sticks fairly well to form as being actual indian and not fusion which is what i tend to see at higher-end indian places i sampled the chicken vindaloo which at a half order contained a surprising amount of tender succulent chicken but not the same amount of potatoes that im used to it has a decent heat to it but not quite the fiery descent thats comically described on the menu the saag paneer is quite nice with a less spinach-y flavor than im used to a much more subtle and balanced version of the heady green beast the name of our third curry escapes me - a blond affair with veggies nice and creamy and delicious - probably my favorite of the three paired up with a bowl of basmati rice and a basket of roti 3 half-sized (8oz) dishes makes for a beyond-filling meal for two props for offering half-size portions if only the price were half too!the drinks list is mighty impressive with a very extensive beer selection some fun cocktails including a whole spate of flavored lassi offerings and of course wine my rose vodka lassi was interesting (tasted like rose!) and the mango rum is exactly what youd expect three half-plates roti and two lassi cocktails came to a sum total of $54 kind of a lot for the amount of food but definitely a higher quality of ingredients than im used to seeing in the street indian i usually seek out the experience including the impeccable service also adds in to the value papadam to start clean plates to transition from papadam to meal and constantly full waters this is probably the largest departure from the dirty hole in the wall spots i hit in sf for my sub-continent fix id definitely come back after spending some more time exploring indian options in lv i love the lunch buffet  tons of food and i like that they bring out fresh naan  the chicken masala and basmati rice are my favorites  the only thing that is lacking is true raita  they have yogurt sauce but its just not the same  so i have to go to india palace for my raita fix  still very good friendly prompt service  every so often i hopefully check to see if 9091 has reopened and end up here  it does quite nicely i am from nj and an indian nj has large indian population but there are only two restaurants that are good i moved to lv two years ago and i had been trying out different indian restaurants for sometime when i went to mint for first time i thought that this was best indian restaurant in lv apart from namaste i just could not believe that ive not written a review on this so here is my experience from last weekendlast weekend i went to mint with my friends and my gf some of them had never been to indian restaurant they were excited to try it out so we ordered the followingshrimp khadhai - $19chicken tikka - $15lamb rebel curry - $153 butter naan (my gfs favorite)- $91 bhathura - $299daal mahkhni (lentils) - $13chicken biryani (fried rice) - $152 chaat appetizer - $16we ordered everything very spicy and it was delicious specially the shrimp khadhai my mouth is watering just writing about it also the free basmati rice that comes with the curries is very delicious and smells amazing all the curries were amazing the chicken biryani was little over cooked but it was spiced wellmy only complaint that i would have is that their full size portions are very small and their full size portions are way smaller than their some restaurants half sized now i know its a good trick to get your customers to buy more food but i think they should be honest on their serving size final bill was $140 plus $30 tip for 5 people not that bad but we had to order more food and we did not order any alcoholpositives  - delicious food - good ambiance negatives - prices seem unreasonably high for the quantity of food (i guess thats what happenes when a restaurant gets famous)overallits just as good as namaste if not better pstheir lunch buffet is good but its not as good when you order of the menu finishing the last episode of gordon ramseys great escape; i had the strongest urge for some flavor packing curries and was instructed to come here by my over-zealous vegan friend this restaurant has such a wide variety of curries of non-vegan and vegan selections  their buffet runs from 11am-3pm and might i say something everyone should become very familiar with  the buffet is only $12 and it comes with such a variety of foods its such a steal!  considering i came here for dinner and ordered chicken tikka masala (buttered chicken) and naan; the bill came out to about $18  the buffet includes chicken/vegetable tikka masala tandoori chicken basmati rice bone-in lamb curry and more dishes i cant pronounceit includes normal and garlic naan! the curry is packed with so much flavor the naan comes out freshly made (hot) the meat of the tandoori and chicken tikka masala is slightly dry but other than that i really cant complain food is an a- for methe only complaint i have is for dinner; their portions are a bit small for what you pay for but nonetheless still very tastyservice is spot on and punctual whenever youre out of drink naan or if you have empty plates; oh yeah their naan is refillable!  our server was extremely friendly wasnt overbearing and took care of us throughout the whole dinnerambiance was very warm lights dim but not dungeness and with trending indian songs to add culture to a very modern looking restaurant  despite having a few indian restaurants surrounding this area ill always return to mint for their money worthy buffet vegan optionsaffable and attentive service and their delicious food met up with a friend for lunch its been a while since ive been here but the buffet is still really good $11 or $12 i dont rememberthey had mint chutney! very good stuff not spicy though they had an interesting basmati rice with cashews dried cranberries and other stuff it was pretty good never had anything like that beforeall of their curries were excellent i really liked the mutton on bone the most the tandoori chicken was a little dry but it usually is lunch had just started so everything was freshlast time i ate here i dunno if i ate too much but i had really bad food coma this time i had 3 plates but feel goodmaybe its the waiters thick indian accent that makes the food taste better at mint but this place is definitely one of the better places to get inidian food in town http://wwwyoutubecom/watch?v=tnwxreoackq told fianc√© i been wanting indian food for a while! we decided to head this way after the gym considering it was just down the street!service was great! at no time did they try torush us and was helpful & patient when we were deciding on what to order refilling our waters and even offering more basmati rice when we were outas far as food we ordered lamb samosas to start with a bit dry and needed some type of sauce but still good our entrees were chicken breast tandoori for me and lamb korma for my date we also ordered their infamous garlic naan! i love anything on a sizzling plate! the chicken was moist and tender! my dish was not spicy at all which is a plus for me because i cant handle tooo spicy! paired perfectly with the basmati rice and i even made a little sandwich bite with the naan grilled onions cut the chicken up and topped with yogurt sauce! delish! the korma was a 7 and i guess it wasnt too spicy either but he likes spice so ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  he said he might go 10 next time they also have an inferno menu where you have to sign waivers! i wonder how serious that is! loloverall a great experience! wish we had room for dessert! until next time,4.357142857142857,14,730 E Flamingo Rd Ste 10 Eastside Las Vegas NV 89119
Pyaar India Restaurant,this is a very tough review for me to write on our trip to pyaar the one good thing i can say about the restaurant is the owners are some of the nicest and most accommodating people you could hope to meet unfortunately i really didnt like my meal hereit should also be noted that this is a review only of the dinner buffet - its possible that ala carte menu ordering will produce a different experienceanyway when my wife and i discovered a new indian restaurant was opening in town we were pleased but the news that this one would feature an indian dinner buffet had us over the moon we are night owls by nature and during vacation times or on weekends we arent always ready to go in time for a lunch buffet - the chance of a dinner option for indian buffet sounded perfecttonight we went in with no expectations $999 or so per person for dinner seemed like a good deal although we were surprised that naan had to be purchased separately (its usually included with the buffet - this is the first time ive seen it as an extra)the selection was small and i ran into immediate problems im not sure if this is synonymous with the particular cuisine pyaar aims at - they claim to me the only north-south-mogul indian restaurant in vegas - but i was surprised at the presence of a couple of beef dishes the lack of any real main dish for vegetarians and nothing at all with the nice sauces ive come to expect from indian food no paneer dish no chicken tikka masala or chicken makhani no samosas no pakora no kofta of any sort  what i ended up with was the only two tandoori chicken drumsticks some of the very wet chilli beef some of the vegetable curry and a lot of ricethe tandoori chicken was fine if unspectacular and id have been ok to eat that and write it off as a notch in the belt but not somewhere i wanted to visit again but unfortunately the rest of the tandoori was thighs which i dont like the chilli beef tasted like a generic beef stew with a bit of chilli powder added potatoes were ok-ish but a bit hard in the vegetable currymy vegetarian wife fared even worse than me - ending up with some chick peas and a bit of potato on top of a bed of basmati riceby the time our naan (which tasted like a flour tortilla) arrived i realised that i had nothing to mop up as there was no dish featuring any of the delicious gravies i have come to associate with indian foodaround 3 minutes into the meal my wife pretended to receive an urgent phone call and we apologised and asked for the check the owners felt bad for us and were extremely nice offering to let us fill up to go boxes from the buffet and they waived the cost of the naan now perhaps its a different type of indian cuisine and its just our personal taste but we really didnt like the buffet here at all i feel bad having to pan this place so harshly because i really liked the owners but i hope if they read this review they consider some changes to their buffet because right now its uninspired bordering on inedible,1.0,1,9350 W Sahara Ave Ste 150 Westside Las Vegas NV 89117
Tandoori Village,very disappointing taste presentation of dishes is very bad ambience is ok service is averagethis is in comparison to so many indian restaurants we ate in usdine date : 2012feb10hope they improve it soonfull details below:4 of us went 2 vegetarians and 2 non-vegetarianspakoda - made of only potato not cut properly generally we expect onion/gobichicken tikka - tastes good juicy and nicely marinated lacks presentation the onions provided are not seasoned and are white onions specifically order for more spicy(hot) but we got it very less spicy dishchicken biryani - specifically ordered for less spicy and its too spicy(hot) has lot of peas and less chicken no coriander added chicken is well cooked but the dish lacks many ingredients doesnt feel like a biryanimutton biryani - specifically ordered for less spicy and i was sweating heavily by the time i left again too many peas and less mutton mutton is tender and cooked well but the dish as such does not have that biryani tastevegetable biryani - except for potato and peas there are no more vegetables cmon at the least we expect a couple of gobi and carrot pieces the side of raita provided is horrible there are no cut onions/tomato/coriander/green chili in it its plane yogurt mixed with lots of waterdal makhani - nice taste and proper quantitybasmati rice - not properly cooked is cooking plane rice so hard??soft drinks - they do refill it but the soda doesnt have proper soda in it its like as if  you leave a coke bottle open for 1/2 hour and drink itpricing - reasonable and equivalent to other indian restaurants service - good the waitress is very presentable doesnt bother to give us choices also doesnt bother to tell our specific needs to the cook seriously?? i can have that in a buffet or in a fast food jointfinally my friend giving us the treat decided he will take us to a better restaurant again everyones disappointed hands down one of the best indian places ive been towhen it comes to restaurants im more of a food-over-service kind of girl the service decor and ambiance dont really matter to me so much as a good meal doesthis place is nothing to look at i think it was a fried chicken shack before tandoori village took over it- and it still looks like it the waiters are teenagers du jour and are acceptable but you might have to flag one down to get your chai or water refilled but like i said that hardly matters when my 5-star review is all about the foodto start order hot chai it will come unsweetened and very hot- but stir and stir with sugar while you wait for your meal youll find yourself strangely addicted to a second cup even if you dont like whole milk (i detest it and this is the only time i drink it)the naan basket is fantastic- a variety of flavored naans onion garlic potato also fantastic is the papadum- its like a flat crispy cracker flavored with indian spices try it with the two chutneys- the green one is mint and hot the other is sweeter and earthier also try mixing them!i love the palak paneer- a spinach dish made with indian cheese- and the basmati rice the vindaloo is also amazing their curries and sauce dishes will share a little easier than their tandoori or grilled dishes- get a variety of sauces and meats and trade around the table for a little sample of everything i always leave a little high on spice and very satisfied its nothing special to look at but it really depends on what you go in wanting if you want a slice of india complete with belly-dancers and ornate carpets you might want to try somewhere else but for fantastic food at reasonable pricesthis is your place!,3.5,2,4255 W Bell Rd Phoenix AZ 85053
Flavor of India,the diverse cuisine from the indian subcontinent varies heavily by religion and ethnicity  this place is owned and run by indian muslims so the food is halal (preparation of the food but especially meat is supervised by imams usually this means a step cleaner more humane than just us government inspected but this isnt always true) and they serve beef curries (you wont find this in hindu establishments just like you wont find any pork in here)  the minimum critical mass of south asian customers is in the area thanks to the elite graduate programs of uw-madison to ensure that any indian restaurant in this town has to be at least pretty good and this one is a step up from that       we first dropped in after a long cold day of protesting for worker rights and inexplicably every other restaurant and bar surrounding the capitol was packed with cold weary protesters this one was empty normally a warning sign but we needed to sit down  a very helpful madison police officer (who all seem ridiculously over-educated) recommended the place but i was a bit leery since he was slim and in good shape i usually get my better restaurant recommendations from fat cops) what a pleasant surprise it was dhinchak (wonderful)!      the service was traditionally unhurried the waiter was friendly and polite and unlike a lot of south asian muslim restaurants quite nice to my consort (my disobedient and independent gori wife and chief of staff)  the papadum was hot fresh and crisp served with what seemed to be fresh made chutneys we enjoyed the shrimp curry chana dal (chickpeas) and palak paneer (a distant cousin of american creamed spinach) make sure you order an indian bread with your meal (chapati paratha nan they have a good selection)  a nice basmati rice came with the meal as it should they have a wide selection of vegetarian dishes almost a requirement in madison     the decor is pleasant though uninspired nicer than the usual casual indian joints but not as elegant as more expensive formal indian restaurants  instead of indian music they piped in some annoying muzak-like smooth jazz though at a forgivable background volume surprising for a muslim establishment they have a good selection of wine and beer some local some indian there really arent many places in wisconsin to have wine from india  still i recommend the indian beer instead      i highly recommend this restaurant for you firangi types who want to try indian food but are leery of the reputed heat of south indian (tamil) cuisine the food here is pretty mild  try to eat the food like we do with your right hand it tastes better that way  if youre a desi bhai who likes your food spicy know that i wasnt successful in getting them to make my food nice and hot but in general ive found that northern indian muslim cooking isnt relatively spicy the food here is quite flavorful its not bland its just not hot enough  i did get the waiter to bring me a hot sauce a red chillies paste which did have a little bite to it  finish your meal with a sweet indian desert like galub jamun and masala tea (chai) and dont expect the waiter to come running up with the bill they employ indo-pakistani manners and expect you to relax after eating  theyre pretty attentive though so they will bring you your check when you signal for it,4.0,1,14 W Mifflin St Ste 102 Capitol Madison WI 53703
Jewel of the Crown,took a walk through the scottsdale arts center area and was convinced by my girl to detour and dine at jewel of the crown  ive seen this place over the years but have always walked right (into az88) instead of left  pleasantly surprised by this authentic looking and tasting indian restaurant  gabriel our waiter suggested the chicken masala  we took his advice and ordered that along with the vegetable korma and a mulligatawny muglai soup  we both enjoyed the tamarind and mint chutney sauces that arrived with the cracker like starter  gabriel explained to us that their mint chutney is made in house with cilantro jalapeno ginger and oil we both thought the meal was impressive and a nice change of flavor and pace  our entrees came with basmati rice as well  we didnt get any of the naan this visit but we will be back!this place is a real diamond in the rough or better yet a jewel of the crown  been in business for 22 years - thats gotta tell you somethin!,3.0,1,7373 E Scottsdale Mall Ste 1 Scottsdale AZ 85251
Rani's World Foods,wow i read the reviews and decided to check it out this place is so cool! amazing selection of indian goods especially sauce mixes the food counter omg tried the paneer and the basmati rice the rice was better than a number of the sit down indian restaurants ive been to and the paneer had a great texture and flavor the price was way better too the little cart of kulfi was also wonderful a complete meal for half of what i would pay at a regular restaurant yay!!! food counter review:thali price alert! thali price alert!the thali is no longer $599  it is $799  there has been a $2 increase  so i told my whole team that it was only $599 for a plate of vegetarian ethnic yumminess based on the yelp reviews  when we arrived i noticed that the where it was supposed to be $599 it was covered with a piece of paper with $799 written on itboo i gave false information to my whole team :(nonetheless we all had thali  the sweet little lady took precious time (a bit slow for our liking since we had to get back to work) to prepare each tray with whatever she want to put on it  my tray consisted of the following:-mashed spinach: doesnt look appetizing but tasted ok  i only ate a few bites of this-eggplant curry:  was delicious and tasty  i finished this-squash something:  i finished this too  it was very refreshing-tofu something:  was decent but not as flavorful  there were three cubes of tofu in this compartment-basmati rice with peas-the rice taste good-purple onion slices with spicy mango sauce: this was supposed to be the pickle veg on the menu  well it doesnt really taste like it would sound  we all thought the sauce tasted like pinesol  we didnt touch this on our tray-roti: tasted like tortilla  i should have asked for parathathe milk tea and purified water was complimentaryi give this a 4 stargrocery store review:my co-worker picked up a bag of naan and a bottle of lychee drink from the grocery side  when she was about to pay for it and flipped over the bag of naan those visible naans were moldy blue in color  the guy that was about to ring it up took it and throw it away  people make sure you inspect the goods before making a purchase  sometimes we tend to not look at it until we are about to enjoy the foodi give this a 3 staroverall: 35 star place this gastro-gem instantly connects me with my former lifetime(s) in india rani dishes up some sumptuous home-style food at the back counter with the love of a dotting grandmother the tangy and fresh chutneys accompany her rich and flavorful veg-fare perfectly her pakoras are a hearty treat and one of the few deep fried foods ill indulge in because how can you say no to your adopted indian grandmother? the rest of the store is a delectable journey through spice i can easily lose track of earthly time here to my less-traveled western epicurians know this is not like the international isle at whole foods expect ; hindi tv ghee-scented air tables sticky with chai resin and dusty nag champa boxes to abound all part of the authenticity and love that is rani world i  recently read that india does irradiate their spices like we do in the west so buying indian spice products are both cost/health effective but do check expiration dates  my staples from these illustrious isles include; star anise tumeric chana besana flour rose water peppered pampadams yellow split-mung beans aspativa basmati rice mustard seed cinnamon bark ghee and the beauty of fresh curry leaves from the produce section,4.0,3,4505 W Sahara Ave Westside Las Vegas NV 89102
Dhaba Indian Bistro,great indian?  my favorite part of this restaurant is their lunch menu (they dont do buffets) it is so affordable so you can take multiple items home to try!  for under $30 my hubby and i ordered the chicken tikka masala shrimp vindaloo lamb biryani (rice dish) garlic naan plan naan and extra raita  all meals come with their cumin toasted basmati rice!  we have enough for at least another meal and half!  i am so excited they opened  havent ate in yet dinning room looks nice and staff is always wonderful during counter service indian food is one of my absolute favorite cuisines for its flavor spice and creativitiy but the price of it versus my grad student budget makes it a special treat only after seeing dhabas affordable lunch menu online i had to try this place out im incredibly happy i didsurprisingly quiet for noon on a saturday but it just meant that my food came to me faster the $695 lamb curry with basmati rice was savory and delicious medium spicy was definitely medium so as a spice enthusiast im getting hot next time for the price i certainly didnt expect a choice of soup or salad with my entree but ta-da! i chose the lentil soup while it was a very small portion it was really good with carrots vegetables and lentils in a light broth the strawberry lassi arrived with whipped cream and a cherry on top like a strawberry shake but one sip revealed a great blend of strawberry with a yogurt tang it went really well with my meallast but not least the naan garlic naan its my weakness and this is some of the best ive had $295 got me a basket full of hot naan crammed full of chopped garlic cilantro and ghee and it was wonderfulso for $13 i got a meat curry soup lassi and naan there are indian restaurants that would charge me that for the entree alone and the quality of the food was the same if not better dhaba is definitely worth a visit a lovely oasis of elegant yet personal table service in a mecca of fast food lunch joints and chain restaurants by greenway plazaextensive menu selection delicate spicing refined presentation--all served by waitstaff who clearly know their menu and are enthusiastic about it attentive service  yet unobtrusive--no  hi im patel your new best friend  business--just genuine care and grace about your experienceall dishes are served promptly (no worries office park crowd)--in lovely crockery and china with starched cloth napkins and substantial silverware--no sporks here--creating an atmosphere of grace and relaxation--even during a busy lunch hour quiet enough to hold a conversation without employing lipreading skills--another plus(no typical indian buffet scene to ensure youll get the flu bug either)dhaba also offers take out menu to consider for dinner when commuting home best basmati rice in town--all very reasonably priced my boyfriend introduced me to dhaba indian bistro a few months back and i have been a fan ever since i have yet to have a bad experience with either the food or service the staff is very friendly and definitely remember regular customers i really enjoy the basmati rice one thing that i do like about dhaba over my favorite lunch spot curry in the box is that they do not use jasmine rice while i do like jasmine rice the basmati rice is a better fit for the curry long grain rice blends very well with the thickness of the curry they offer a large variety of curries ranges from types of currys and spice levels the work on a 1-5 scale of spiciness with 5 being the hottest let me just say that i have gotten a yellow shrimp curry dish on a 2 scale and it was spicy so be warned a scale of 1 is your safest bet my boyfriend who loves spicy food can barely withstand a 3they offer quite a bit of curries shrimp chicken beef lamb goat etc i must admit that i am not the biggest fan of their cheese roti bread i definitely prefer curry in the box roti bread over dhaba however dhabas bread is more thicker making it easy to dip the bread into the curry and eat their prices do go up during dinner even though ive only gone during their lunch hours i was told by a regular that their serving sizes arent any different from lunch to dinner so keep that in mind its a nice outing for people who really enjoy indian food and/or curry i know for some people the smell of curry really turns them away from eating at places like such but the restaurant does a great job with hiding the smells curry can be very overwhelming but the aroma when you dine ad dhaba is very invitingi would give them a 35 stars,4.25,4,8333 Greenway Blvd Ste 100 Middleton WI 53562
India Masala Bar & Grill,this place is beautiful the decor is classy enough for date night yet not so over the top that you feel under dressed at lunch   it is as all buffets should be clean and neat and well stocked we came here after a disappointing stop at ghandi the week earlier the service here is wonderful very nice and friendly also mindful and considerate full water glasses at all times we were offered fresh naan bread and it was great the mango lassi was affordable and generous i do not know what is expected of indian dishes officially i only know if like what i had or not so please keep that in mind  the first time we went we loved it there were large chunks of chicken in the butter chicken and an amazing lamb curry kessla ? dessert which was over the top we loved this lemon rice and unique vegetarian dishes i gave a try well cooked basmati rice tandoori chicken soups pakora  the second time came around and it was also great!! the chicken curry was amazing!  told friends then came a third time andhmm  things changed butter chicken had tiny thin strands of chicken not at all the same kind from before there was no lamb curry which was disappointing to me and some dishes that looked good but had bones in them including the chicken curry (the first time it was made without bones) (i personally wont eat any gravies or curries with bones) there was a mango dessert that was unique  i never tried the salads and smaller items by the time i make it to the back wall i am full i did not count how many items but there is surely enough to choose from  so we would prefer more consistency in quality as customers however thats the only issue we had here no one got sick nothing bad happened it was a pleasant experience the place is really nice and deserves a shot  i never had dinner here and i am dying to try the cashew chicken well go back thats for sure this relatively new restaurant is an upscale offshoot of india masala located in the riviera food court  it is decent size and nicely appointed  we shared vegetarian and tandori thalis that included a variety of vegetarian entrees and sides pappadum with chutneys tandori chicken basmati rice naan chicken tika and rice pudding  everything tasted pretty good but i thought prices were high in relation to the quantity of food served  on our next visit i will opt for either the luncheon buffet or order regular entrees  a rating of 25 would be more appropriate the wife and i went for dinner as a spur of the moment thing upon walking in we were impressed with the ambiance it was open and airy we were warmly greeted and seated at the table we were our server presented us with a basket of delightfully light and crisp chips accompanied by plum and mint chutney dips our server was dmitri he was great he was speedy without being pushy he knew the menu and was willing to accommodate special requestswe ordered the tilapia appetizer the portion could have been an entree for two the fish was appropriately flaky without being dry it was spicy without assaulting the taste buds i had to hold back so that i would have room for the main course these did not disappoint i had the lamb curry at spice level 8 and my wife had the chicken masala at spice level 3 the chicken had to be special ordered the chicken normally used has the red-pink coloring to it this tends to upset my wifes stomach dmitri was able to convey this to the chef and the chef nailed it most importantly we did not have to wait any longer for this modified meal and by the way the chicken was amazing juicy flavorful and sliced just right the lamb was the same i sampled both over a nicely prepared bed of basmati rice  i only regret not saving room for dessert next timeanother impressive thing was the menu selection oftentimes indian restaurants only serve regional dishes this menu offers a full culinary tour of india i am not one for buffets but i might try theirs just to take the full tourthe pricing was reasonable had we not ordered the tilapia and mango lassi (which was extraordinary) our meal with tip would have been about $4200 that is a great dinner price just about anywhere but is an exceptional value in vegasthis place hit the grand slam for me: ambiance service food and price we stopped for dinner last night as it had been awhile since we had indian food  since we got there right at 5 pm which is their opening time the place was empty and we were seated immediately  water was brought quickly and we also ordered regular iced tea  the server came back and said they were out of regular iced tea and they only had the sweetened raspberry tea  we got that insteadfor an appetizer we ordered the medhu wada two deep fried doughnuts made from ground lentils rice and black pepper  with it was served three chutneys or sauces that added some to the dryness of the wada  the sauces were a tomato based one a soup and a coconut based one  the wadas were very flavorful and after chewing you got the flavor of the black pepper  when our server went to clear the dishes she asked if we wanted to keep any of the chutneys  i kept the soup and ate it  it was great!for dinner my wife ordered the garlic chicken and i ordered madras curry chicken spice level 7 on a 1 to 10 basis  we also ordered some garlic naan  dinner came with basmati rice  we both liked our meals and we had garlic chicken to bring home for another meal for one of us  the garlic naan was good for dessert we shared a dish of kheera couple of things keep me from ranking the place higher  on one of the hottest days this summer the restaurant was very warm  i dont like freezing in a place either and i always take a denim long sleeve shirt with me  i sure didnt need it as i was perspiring and it wasnt from the curry  speaking of that 7 is not high enough for a good spice level  their 7 was rather tame and the curry seemed to be lacking some of the rich flavor it should have  perhaps im spoiled by thai curry  i think i need to stay away from indian curry  the kheer had no pistachio chunks on it which somewhat makes the dish interesting  i saw the photo that westie w posted and i thought that it was really enticing  the no regular iced tea threw me  i was going to ask them if i could have some hot water and a tea bag and a glass of ice  i could have made my own  out of iced tea is so lame  we bought a yelp deal which is in essence a $5 off deal  this place is ok but i wont be returning  there are good good fully supplied indian restaurants in town we had a very tasty meal here tonight the mango lassi had full mango flavor! yummy! the chapati and sauces were the best i have had and yes i have eaten indian food before  many times although not in india but in london we ordered chicken tikka dosa goat curry basmati rice and naan it was our first time having a dosa not sure that we have seen this on a menu before but we are glad that we tried it! if you have never had one and you like crepes this is a must have! of course the sauces that went with it were just delightful bursting with flavor in every bite the curry was also very flavorful and so was the wonderful naan we order the rice so the goat curry had something to sit onfor two of us we had way too much food but managed to eat most of it service was very attentive and pleasant wonderful experience and great food,4.0,5,1040 E Flamingo Rd Eastside Las Vegas NV 89119
Kabob n Kurry,this restaurant just recently opened  i checked out the place today for lunch  lunch is served buffet-style with over 8 different dishes to choose from  everything was really good & many of the dishes are at least a little spicy  my favorites were the basmati rice chicken fried rice hot chicken wings & chicken tikka masala  they serve up some naan to the table & that was very good too  everything was very rich & flavorful & you can tell they use high quality ingredients for all their dishes  i special ordered a non-dairy mango lassi & it was delicious!  vicky was the guy that ran the place there  he was great!  he didnt give me the feeling he was hovering but he was there to refill my water glass when needed & he also brought out some chicken kabob from the kitchen for me to try  that was also delicious!  he also knows how to create some ambiance - when there was a younger crowd that came in he changed up the music to something that they would like this is a great place for some top quality indian food  at $5 per person for a lunch buffet (drinks excluded but also extremely reasonable) you cant find anything else that comes close in price & quality  if youre in the area you should go check it out! = = =  friday thru sunday lunch buffet!  = = =stopped back in here today for the lunch buffet which is now held on friday through sunday each week     :-)this is a small simple restaurant with just a 10-item buffet but the food is very tasty & some of the dishes have been brand new to me on each of my visitstodays selection included choup chicken chicken kadai chicken tikki masala daal palak mixed vegetables warm red suji halwa chana masala and basmati rice with warm naan bread brought to the table and farni rice pudding for dessert  the three chicken dishes and the chana masala were especially goodlunch buffet is priced low at $699 and if you enjoy south asian food youre sure to like this place!     :-)),4.0,2,1430 W Warner Rd Ste 126 Gilbert AZ 85233
Curry Corner,super tasty love the cozy atmosphere excellent and friendly service!  the naan was a bit thinner and crispier than some others which i really dug  we had a goat dish that was outstanding  nicely spiced  also had the non-vegetarian thali - two chicken curries (one with a bit of sour pickle taste that was very nice) daal basmati rice and a little salad  quite inexpensive  and i like the less-thick lassi with ice i went here last week with a large group (6 people) we ordered 5 dishes including two orders of chicken tikka masala goat curry chicken achari and palak paneer overall we all (including one friend who is indian) thought it was not the best indian food we have hadthe tikka masala was alright but wasnt as rich or flavorful as other tikka masalas i have had i did not care for the chicken achari but i have not had that before so it may just not be something i like in general the palak paneer was alright but again was somewhat bland the goat curry in my opinion was the best thing we had it had a lot of goat flavor (which i like) and was generally tasty the meals all came with either rice or naan but disappointingly the rice was plain white rice (no spices in it like most basmati rices) and the naan was also plain still nice that it was includedwhich brings me to the reason this place is 3 stars and not 2it is soo inexpensive! we each paid six dollars and change for all of that foodmost places would be well over 10$ each so that is worth an extra star all on its own i probably wouldnt come here if you want amazing food but if you want decent food on the cheap this is your place! very deceiving from the outside but the food was very unique! its rare to find a place that sells delicacies from pakistan or afghanistan i tried the goat dish the meat was very tender though a bit fatty but i didnt mind since it was very flavorful it was stewed in a thick and flavorful sauce you get either naan or basmati rice with the dish but we got both our meal ended with clove-infused rice pudding which was addicting! our server was very friendly and had good recommendations there is no ambiance so dont go expecting a classy atmosphere this place is for people that appreciate good and unique food looking forward to trying more off of their amazing menu! i thought this place was going to be better based on reviews but i guess not you enter in through the hookah place next door and you are obligated to get your own drinks i love indian food i make it at home all of the time but sometimes i like to venture out the lowdown:*i got the tikka masala fries and they were good but they desperately needed salt*mattar paneer also needed salt and spice i thought this food was supposed to be full of flavor and spice?no creamy texture and the cheese was rubbery and more firm than it is supposed to be *my partners lamb curry was sadly laden with oil and you could see the separation between the tomato curry and the oil sitting on top the biggest part of the lamb that was saved for last was mostly if not all fat *basmati rice needed salt as well and im not a salt fiend! more oil would have helped to make it moist *garlic naan was crispy and hotin conclusion: tikka masala fries and naan were good i was disappointed at the lack of flavor everything had if you want one of the best experiences go to royal taj here in tempe if you want some of the best indian food in your life go to delhi palace in flagstaff at woodlands village my indian friend suggested i go and try their goat biryani and mango lhassi i have to say the portions are huge! it tasted really good and you could tell that they used good quality basmati rice i couldnt finish half of what was in my plate the mango lhassi was really refreshing and sweet! loved it! the only issue i have with this place is the service! really horrible we came around 12 noon and there were very few customers there but oh my! the waitress was super slow it took 15 minutes to get the lhassi and get this--- she doesnt even offer you a straw as she serves you with it you would have to go get the straw from their counter i dont get that  i mean she is already serving the drink why wouldnt she serve the straw as well the only redeeming thing is that their price is super cheap for the amount and quality of the food that you get i will come back some other day and i hope that the service gets better!,3.4,5,1212 E Apache Blvd Tempe AZ 85281
Sutra Fine Indian Cuisine,it was the first time for my husband and i to try indian cuisine  we both liked it very much  yes we will be coming back to this place!!we ordered the non-veg assorted snack (seesh kebab fish pakoras & chicken pakoras) for an appertizer  the seesh kebab was minced lamb mixed with spcies cooked on skeker in clay oven not like the normal kebab you think it is  the taste was different not my cup of tea  but the fish and chicken parkora was very goodfor our entrees ordered up a karahi lamb-boti masala (boneless tansoori lamb in a tomatoe and butter gravy) and chicken biryani (basmati rice with chicken cooked with nuts herbs raisins and spices)  the karahi lamb dish was served as medium and the chicken biryani was served as mild  the lamd dish was too hot for me (but then i am a super lightweight) but the flavor was good  i loved my chicken biryani the aromatic rice herb and spices was just wonderful to smell and taste  the waitress suggested the garlic naan bread  it was like a pita with small chunks of garlic and herb  it was very tasty too  we got to chatting with the owners  they were very patience to explain what everything was and give us different sauces to try (cucumber yogurt minty cream etc) with our dishes  they also brought out a sample of the kheer (rice pudding) my husband inhaled it  he loved it!,4.0,1,13824 W McDowell Rd Ste 100 Goodyear AZ 85395
Flavors of India,im giving this place a generous 4 stars because the food is actually very tasty ive been here twice now and im never disappointed indian food has to be on the top of my list for favorite cuisines and i am sad to say there arent many or any great indian restaurants that i have found in phoenix flavors of india however seems to satisfy my palate i enjoy the chicken tikka masala every time i have also tried the curry chicken which is also very tasty the chicken is very fresh and tender both the light and dark meat the naan is a bit flat and not soft or chewy enough for my taste but it does its job i really enjoy their basmati rice its not the most elaborate or flavorful ive ever had but for some reason im drawn to it and even crave it theres no saffron or cloves; its a bit on the simple side and just a tad bit sticky the samosas are decent although i have had better if you are in the mood for some indian food and this place is close by i suggest you head on over prices are reasonable two can eat for 30 bucks including multiple appetizers the food is prepared quickly its not the prettiest of restaurants but it has its interesting indian decor with a twist of mexican thrown in at least thats my impression i dont like that they are closed on sundays since thats when i typically like to eat indian food the quantity is definitely sufficient and you will have left overs unless you like to pig out   try it youll probably like it! unlike other reviewers i didnt like the buffet though my friends from work think its a good value however ive been going for dinner to flavors of india for nearly three years now and have always liked the food foi is my first choice for indian cuisine in phoenix out of the four other indian restaurants in the valley ive tried yes foi is in a strip mall but once inside the ambiance is pleasant it seems quite clean i never got sick from anything i ate there (thats saying a lot as i admit to being a fussy eater) and the waitstaff is helpful bollywood videos on the large flat-screen wall display in the corner are an unusual feature but the volume is low or completely muted so you can watch or choose not to it isnt distracting   (heres a footnote about that: i ate at foi on the night of the presidential primary election my dining companion noticed that most of the waitstaff was gathered around the tv in the bar watching electoral results so he asked our waiter if we could watch too after getting the enthusiastic okay from the two other occupied tables it was quite late in the evening silent bollywood was replaced by live news coverage with volume turned on)regarding the food: i love their mattar paneer (cooked peas in a tasty curried gravy with small cubes of homemade mild-tasting cheese)  my super-spicy friend gets the lamb vindaloo (super-spiced as he requests)  tandoori shrimp chicken and tikka masala are good though a bit pricier the samosa appetizer (lightly battered and deep-fried cut vegetables) is fresh warm and crunchy regular and garlic nan bread are everything they should be biryani rice is overpriced (id stick with basmati rice as a side dish) and sweet lassi (a well-chilled dairy drink similar in taste and consistency to a vanilla yogurt smoothy) is a nice treat my spicy friend says his gin-and-tonic was weak and they dont have ingredients to make a bloody mary but hey foi is an indian restaurant so i cant fault them too much for that! other pluses: open a bit later than many phoenix restaurants (seating ends at 9:30 pm); very fast with takeout orders; theres lots of parking; the 16 north bus stop is nearby; silverware glasses white cotton tablecloths and napkins are always spotlessly clean pretty standard indian and by standard i mean this is what you will find at almost every indian restaurant in america i am no genuine indian food expert but your average usa indian restaurant will have the same menu as every other one no matter what city or state youre in that being said if thats what youre in the mood for then foi will fit the bill its in a very sad-looking strip mall and the management of the restaurant must be very anxious about all of the empty storefronts around them but the interior of the restaurant is spacious and comfortable and when i walked in to pick up our takeout order i was immediatelly greeted by a very friendly host the food was good as far as overly-oily typical indian fare goes we ordered the tandoori chicken tandoori fish naan and a cauliflower and potato dish all were very tasty and served with basmati rice i have two criticisms of the food:1)the onions in the tandoori dishes were raw perhaps if we had eaten there they would have been served in a cast-iron skillet which would have improved matters ill withhold final judgment until we try it again the meats were all very good though2)oily oh my goodness there must have been equal parts oil and vegetables in the cauliflower dish i wonder if indian restaurants are under the impression that americans really do want their food swimming in oil and thats why they make it that way or if true indian food in india is also as oily as what youll find at restaurants here? i dont have the answer **i will put in a plug here for bombay spice at tatum and shea which is indian food made healthfully without nearly as much oil or cream as most restaurants i wish i could count on that everywhere **so it was a solid 3-star experience given that it met my expectations of very oily very tasty average indian food it would definitely earn another star or two if someone in the kitchen made an effort to cook with health in mind its really not hard = = = = = =  daily lunch buffet!  = = = = = = it took me over two years to circle back around to this one but it was so good today!  i was joined by norm r & mike c for lunch this time & started with some nice indian style salad  then it was on to most of the rest of the 21 food choiceswarm naan bread was brought to our table & i eventually bit may way through some basmati rice tandoori chicken kandhari chicken makhani beef meat balls (what is beef doing here?¬ø?) palak tadka (spinach with tofu) daal makhani (really good lentil soup) gajar halwa (carrot pudding) various treats such as chilly potato & onion+cauliflower pakoras chana masala (chick pea dish) rice and mango desserts & moreeverything was just right here today for an indian buffet and reasonable too at $915 plus tax so its 5 stars this time for flavors of india  yum!     :-)) yesterday was my first time trying indian food (dont judge meeeee!) and im now hooked! anyone who hasnt tried indian food or is curious and wants to sample - go here this review is based on the lunch buffet which beats out chinese buffets any day of the week you have a selection of 9-10 choices plus dessert the neatest part is the variety of food switches every day so youre never eating the same thing over and over yesterdays buffet consisted of chicken masala (chicken spices tomato sauce cooked) daal makhani (lentil soup) bhindi (bombbbb okra!) chicken curry and a ton of other goodies (dessert was shahi kheer - basmati rice pudding with almond and pistachios) my only complaint was the bread as it felt like it was covered in oil however for $1199 and all you can eat - i dont really careside note: they play this channel on their tv thats an indian version of mtv - so freaking entertaining,4.2,5,4515 N 16th St Phoenix AZ 85016
Chutney's Indian Cuisine,35 - love the new digs nice tables and ambiance wife got lamb curry @ 2 spice levels was mild but a whole lotta flavori got the shrimp vindaloo @ 5 spice levels heat mm heat  very flavorful as well sauce was awesome to dip the garlic bread in not a huge fan of basmati rice though with you had choice of jasmine but all in all we will be backthanksfyi: front door isnt just a pull on handle you need to press the top lever then pull almost seemed like the place was closed while having my hair dyed in yuma prior to going to visit family up in queen creek the topic of indian food came up as my son and i make it a tradition to go for indian food in every city that we visit my beautician told me that i absolutely have to go to chutneys  even though it was slightly off course for our trip we found it easily the place was beautifully decorated and relaxing with its soft lighting after our long journey the wait staff was extremely attentive and the owner walked around and chatted with us making this that much more a wonderful experience then came the foodwe had samosas garlic naan lamb sag basmati rice and some other amazing dishes i am originally from ny and miss the high quality restaurants found there but chutneys delivered  this will surely be a pitstop whenever we travel that way in the future  and we begged them to open a restaurant in yuma as well,4.5,2,1801 E Baseline Rd Ste 104 Tempe AZ 85283
Pasand,recently enjoyed a thali dinner which consists of papadum; choice of chutney (mango or hot carrot); sambar (tomato-based soup); raita (yogurt-based soup with cucumbers and spices; daal (curry-based soup consisting of lentils and spices); tamarind soup*; choice of entree; two pooris (deep-fried bread puffs- i asked to substitute paratha- pan-fried wheat bread); basmati rice; and dessert (one pc gulab jamun)  my choice picks were hot carrot chutney (very salty and greasy and i cant recommend it to anyone) and palak mutter paneer (spinach peas and cheese cubes in a coconut curry sauce)*(tamarind is a sweet and sour ingredient used in flavoring asian entrees and can also be made into a popular candy with many versions- three versions i know of are salty/sour salty/sweet/sour and sweet/spicy!)i dont think ill be ordering thali dinners here anymore since the raita and sambar are made with ingredients im allergic to  i would recommend the palak mutter paneer entree except the serving is pretty small even for me  (i like serving sizes that allow me to splurge and still have enough left over for a meal-- id say three goldilocks-portioned servings- you know not-too-big not-too-small just right)  another strike against ordering a thali dinner here dessert consists of one piece of gulab jamun!  what a tease!  perhaps one piece would satisfy the majority of diners out there but for a super-sweet tooth such as me either give me at least two pieces of gj or dont give me any at all! wow its been almost a year since i visited pasand  better get back over there & see how theyre doingthe first remarkable thing here is that there are at least three buffet restaurants right in this center!  peter piper pizza (pretty bad) china town buffet (a little banged up but good food!  4-stars) & pasand here  most landlords wouldnt allow more than one buffet-serving tenant at a timeso lets see how well pasand holds its own here & competes with its indian rivals in the area:ok first the bad  theres no salad & barely any dessert!  fine so its 1-star & were out of here right?  well just before that lets see if they have any soupaha!! as they say in india(?)  theres sambar with pureed lentils carrot slices & more & uh-oh its delicious!  then theres the rasam which is tamarind soup of all things  its unusual its spicy & its good  lastly today anyway there was dahl soup  this has lentils spinach tomato pieces & more & it was really good so never mind the salad!for solid food youve got your basmati rice  they make it really good here  buttery with lots of little things in it  then today there was potato pakora which is little fried potato pancakes  delicious!  same for the little curly-q cabbage pakora goodies  their tandoori chicken is excellent too & they keep it moist with a foil cover  their chicken makhani is very good toolunch buffet $833 including beverage  they open at 11:30 am & theyre closed monday but whatever other day youre hungry for some delicious indian food hop on your elephant (or in your mahindra) & get over here!notes:*  since the food is spicy here youre kids might have trouble with it*  they dont have the full bar you always see at indian restaurants but if you ask they can whip out some beer & wine!*  i had this place at 3 stars but i find myself craving it & coming back here all the time so i guess im a serious fan!,3.5,2,1801 E Baseline Rd Ste 104 Tempe AZ 85283

India Gate,to sum up the food experience i have to say that ive had better  i went to try out their lunch buffet  the restaurant was clean as it was still showing the grand opening sign out front  the buffet options was not very impressive  they had veg pakora (cold) and no samosas  their meat options were chicken tikka masala which was very dissapointing  it was a tomato base with absolutely no spices  it could have used some garam masala and some ginger and other indian spices  it tasted like tikka masala out of a jar  it just did not give you a sense of any effort was made  the tandoori chicken was also bland with absolutely no flavor  again where is the indian spices?  the vegetable dishes were saag paneer and dahl fry which were both ok but no aloo gobi??  i have to admit the basmati rice and garlic naan were the best thing there  another big disappointment was the gulab jamun dessert which was ice cold  i prefer the honey syrup to be warmas if it was frozen and just defrosted   basically nothing other than the rice and bread tasted home made  i will definitely not be back! = = = = = =  weekday lunch buffet!  = = = = = =it has taken me a couple of months since the opening of this new india gate location to whip over here because my experience at their other location in chandler three years ago wasnt that great and i only gave it 2 stars  also and no this shouldnt have anything to do with it but my experience with the former indian buffet that closed exactly here in this room a little over a year ago deep palace was only 2 stars  ugh     :-(   ok so its a brand new day time to get over prejudices and here i am     :-)this buffet today was smallish featuring about 15 items  i started with some chana masala (chick pea soup) & it was delicious  then it was on to salad which was the usual indian fare of lettuce cucumber tomatoes skip the jalepe√±os & top it with raita dressing  the lettuce was coarsely shredded rather than leafed which i likedback in my comfortable booth i received a nice basket of hot from the oven naan bread buttered & very lightly seasoned  then it was on to a variety of the usual indian buffet dishes including basmati rice chicken curry chicken tikki masala and tandoori chickeneverything was good here and the service friendly so its a solid 3 stars for this nice restaurant where the weekday lunch buffet is an inexpensive $799 with a free coupon from their website     :-) i came here on friday night with a groupon and no high expectation and this place turn out really good i ordered the tandoori chicken saag shrimp garlic naan basmati rice and mango lassi all delicious the food did not take long but the service was slow only 1 waiter so i hope they can hire someone quick you will need to give good service to keep the restaurant running :-)next time i will try their dinner buffet omg!  i would have never thought that i would find the best indian food ever in gilbert azmy husband and i went for for dinner this past sunday and when we walked into a totally empty restaurant we were worried    however our fear was unnecessary  the wait person jokingly referred to himself as prince ali and could not have been more helpful  he thoroughly explained the appetizers and asked us questions to lead us to the right dinners choiceswe ordered samosas and some kind of fried cheese as appetizers  they were just fairthe entrees were something else completely  my husband had saag lamb - very tender chunks of lamb in what was more like a spicy spinach sauce rather than spinach as a side dish per se  i cant recall the menu name of what i ordered but it was shrimp in a butter/yogurt sauce with medium spice  outstanding!  we ordered rice with vegetables on the side - basmati rice with bits of  veggies and some spices maybe saffron  you would not believe how delicious it was!  also dont forget the naan  order more to take home for tomorrowseriously if you are a fan of indian food or are trying it for the first time run do not walk to india gate please resist the urge to eat from the buffet while i have not had it here my experience is the food is too generic  read the menu decide how spicy you want it and get it the way you like it wow just had some great indian food i had the dinner plate which was an amazing three course meal which included mughlai soup followed up by chicken tikka masala chicken makhni and basmati rice the flavors were amazing and all of the ingredients tasted very fresh for desert we had kheera type of rice pudding which acted as a great balance after the spice overall a great find i cant wait to eat there again no surprises here at this simple buffet for $799 you can pig out on various vegetable dishes chicken entrees salad and sweets like gulab jamun and carrot halwathe buffet was pretty basic they had your standard dishes youd see at an indian buffet such as vegetable korma chicken tikka masala a saag (spinach) dish and some dark meat tandoori chicken they also had a tray of chicken vindaloo a bright red dish with spicy heat! unfortunately the dishes were lacking in that certain punch that makes indian food when done right so remarkable the vegetable korma was a little runny in consistency and seemed to consist mainly of potatoes and not much else same could be said for the vindaloo i couldnt really find any pieces of chicken in it just potato the chicken tikka masala was ok but nothing really too impressive there was also a tray of veggie pakora and basmati rice i enjoyed the veggie pakora the most out of all the savory dishes there were a lot of veggies packed into the fritter fried until tender with a tasty batter i also enjoyed the fresh garlic naan brought to the table there was also a salad area condiments such as raita and chutney and some dessert out of the two desserts (carrot halwa and gulab jamun) i liked the gulab jamun the most it had that nice tender cake-like texture that the dish typically has soaked in some sweet syrupsoda fountain drinks are $199 and consist of coke productsthe buffet for lunch is from monday through friday the saving grace of the meal was the price point since it was just $799 i wasnt too disappointed that my meal consisted of mainly potatoes in various curries rather than a multitude of various meats and veggies,3.6666666666666665,6,1674 N Higley Rd Ste 104 Gilbert AZ 85234

Gandhi India's Cuisine,despite being located in a seedy strip mall a friend and i had previously tried this place for dinner and it was decent 3-star territory however a recent visit to try their lunch buffet was a different story the first thing that stuck out was the cheap plastic plates disposable plastic eating utensils and styrofoam/plastic cups for water and soups/sauces i have been to many indian lunch buffets but this was the first time ive seen such cheap dining ware being used while they had several vegetarian offerings they only had a couple of mediocre meat dishes: chicken tikka masala and tandoori chicken there was a huge tray of naan which looked overly doughy and dried out so i didnt even bother trying it the subpar mango pudding was too watery and contained cheap canned fruit the halwa dessert was extremely dry and just gross my friend and i commented that the only thing at the buffet that they seemed to do pretty well was the basmati ricewhen the bill came i was in for another shock $1295 for an indian lunch buffet?!? that has got to make this the priciest one in town since most are in the range of $999 to $1099 now if this buffet was one of the best i probably wouldnt mind paying a premium price come to think of it if they lowered the price to $895 it still wouldnt be worth it there are just too many better places in town ie taj palace or mt everest to waste your appetite on this one wow! driving down flamingo and saw a couple of indian food joints ghandi had an authentic feelafter going inside and seeing a buffet style set up i was a little thrown off after asking the lady she explained you can either do the buffet or order off the menu i decided to stay because there were so many people therethe food was so good so good that i went back for dinner the same night for dinner i ordered off the menu (there is no buffet at night anyways) and i cannot believe the results the food off the menu was even better than the buffet (which was already some of the best indian food ive had) i will be eating here every chance i get every time im in vegasfavs: chicken masala lentil soup basmati rice garlic naan the dessert @ buffet  ;-) (make sure to combine them!),3.0,2,4080 Paradise Rd Ste 9 Eastside Las Vegas NV 89169
Bawarchi Indian Cuisine,last night i tried bawarchi a little hole -in- the wall fairly new place on bell road  the place is clean and attractive and has a reasonably priced menu  we saw that most of the clientele was ethnic so it reasoned that the food would be good  we started out with two meat samosas made with ground lamb (399)  not greasy and full of meat flavored beautifully with fragrant spices enjoyed it very much they were accompanied by coriander chutney and a tamarind/spicy mixture dont know what that was  we also had chicken vindaloo (699) chicken biryani lamb chops and naan  the chicken biryani was accompanied by lentils and yogurt the yogurt was amazing as were the lentils whose flavor profile included coconut  the lamp chops serving was ample but the lamb was chopped into pieces  my eating partner said they tasted good  the vindaloo was very good although not as spicy as i had asked them to make it restaurants are afraid to add too much spice until they get to know you  everything was great until i decided to order the kheer (100) for dessert  i like my kheer with raisins and i asked if it had raisins to which they answered yes  no raisins in the kheer but i found it to be very strange (at least for me) i have never ever had kheer with noodles in it meaning kheer which is a rice pudding is usually made with basmati rice well this one had noodles as well and i i did not enjoy it  since it costs only $1 i did not make a fuss if i had paid over $3 i would have returned it to them  when i got up to pay for the kheer (because we had already paid our bill) the owner did not want to charge me for the kheer (maybe he read my mind or my stomach)  i resisted the temptation (not to pay) and insisted the owner take his money  (i do want them to stay in business!)   it is a family run business and it shows  i dont have a problem eating off of paper plates with plastic utensils if this bothers you this is not the place for you by the time we left at 8:30pm the restaurant was almost full of patrons obviously the word has gotten out that there is good food to be had here seeing all the indian families eating there is further proof that the food must be seasoned and prepared authentically  i thought so  we really really enjoyed our meal bawarchi minus the kheer,4.0,1,3607 E Bell Rd Ste 6 Phoenix AZ 85032

Mount Everest India's Cuisine,veggie options are very good here! i love the basmati rice it is cooked to perfection!i have been here many times and they have different options in veggie dishes my last visit they had an excellent cabbage dish which was sauteed in yummy herbs and spices [curry] makes the world go aroundthe world go aroundthe world go around[curry] makes the world go aroundit makes the world go round- money from cabaret [with some slight changes]theres a reason indian restaurant lunch buffets are so popular -- all the curry you can eat and lots of varieties  mt everest knows it and does a great job with its buffet  options of vegetarian curry lamb curry chicken curry anchor the buffet offerings and they are all tasty although a little lacking in spice (those looking to set the roof [of their mouth] on fire will be a little disappointed)  what makes mt everests buffet exceptional are the additional offerings -- delicious samosas sweet sticky rice soft basmati rice and free warm garlic naan on the table  all of which makes this the best indian buffet in town whats up with me? 2 indian buffets in 4 days that must be a first for me i dont think ive been to one for six months prior to this my craving for the indian buffet had not been satiated by my visit to mint and so i was determined to have a good experience today after extensive research on yelp i decided to try mt everest a co-worker of mine agreed to join me (ditching his diet) thanks to the fact that shari s had described the naans here as being billowy we made the long 10 mile trudge to mt everest from the office this buffet is seriously amazing for a little tiny place charging 899 per person it seriously hit every craving and made us happy campers there is an extensive vegetarian selection in the buffet: soft basmati rice with peas palak paneer punjabi kadi malai kofta dhal cauliflower and potato stirfry sambar idly samosas pakoras and a myriad of chutneys yogurt salad and dips i have only good things to say about every single dish on the buffet tasted good and the ingredients were all fresh indian buffets frequently omit primo dishes like paneer (indian cottage cheese cubes) kofta (indian dumplings in gravy) samosas and fresh (not frozen) veggies in their food mt everest did no such thingthey spared no expense and made this buffet experience fantastic my co-worker who eats meat couldnt stop raving about the creamy chicken makhani lamb curry and the samosas (he went pretty crazy with all the chutneys) and yes the garlic naans that came with the buffet (we asked for garlic) were billowy and extremely tasty my only gripe with mt everest is the dessert selection they had sweet ricewhich really is a cop-out dessert but i settled for their fresh fruit selection (oranges and watermelon) i would give these guys a 45 stars (taking off a half star for the dessert) but since i cant on yelp they get a four next time if they serve gulab jamun i will be more than happy to up it to a no-questions asked 5 star reviewits truly heartwarming to see an indian buffet keep its quality consistent even after being open a while mt everest really did warm my heart and brought back some of my lost hope in the indian buffet genre in las vegas thanks to all the yelpers that did a wonderful job describing this place you guys were spot on! we received pappadum plus delicious tamarind and mint sauces to begin our meal and after an exceptionally long wait we received our aloo tiki deep fried mashed potatoes which were overdone and virtually inedible  a few minutes later the remainder of our meal chicken makahani lamb saag plain basmati rice and kabuli naan (stuffed with raisins and nuts) appeared  the naan was flat as a pancake and the filling was very bland  both entrees were large and delicious though the lamb was on the tough side we concluded the meal with a shared portion of carrot halwa which was a bit too sweet  service other then by the busboy was abysmal from start to finish  the sole waiter i am guessing the owner sat in a booth across the room from us playing with a cell phone and never once looked in our direction to determine if we or any of the other diners needed anything  i had to call the busboy over to get our check and then it took the waiter an inordinate amount of time to process the payment another lunch favorite!  ive been several times for lunch and always eat at the buffet  the food is delicious; theres various traditional options including basmati rice samosas chicken dishes (eg chicken tikka) dal makhani and other vegetarian dishes  theres also fruit  the buffet actually has a good variety of food  my absolute favorite is the sweet rice which is orange colored and has peanuts (or cashews?) in it  i have a sweet tooth and love rice so this is the best of both worlds for me  im not a huge meat eater but am not vegetarian either so i end up loading up on the sweet rice    my runner-up favorite (or actually maybe tied) is the naan  whoa nelly the naan is always warm and soft  we always get a basket that has plain naan and naan with garlic  the garlic naan is super good  although im sure its a huge faux pas i love getting the orange marmalade from the buffet (for the fruit) and putting just a little on the naan  thats my dirty little secret at mt everestoverall its a great place to have lunch  its generally busy or at least half way full  i think it also feels a little nicer because the tables in the center of the restaurant have linen table cloths  oh! and another plus -- they usually have a bollywood movie playing on a flat screen tv above the buffet  the sound is not on or is low but its fun to watch nevertheless! have eaten the lunch buffet here at least 15-18 times over the course of 3 years and i must say that mt everest is finally in its prime i immediately sensed a new chef 2 visits ago and my guess was confirmed by the owner the owner was visibly excited about the new chefs contributions smiling and describing all of the new dishes tastewise and lookswise the buffet has never been better it costs $1 more than before but it is worth it the sambar soup is perfectly seasoned the new dishes (chicken chili vegetable korma) are colorful and tasty and the overall spice level is kicked up one notch closer to a straight-up medium the chicken mahkani is masterful and complex - as good as some of the best chicken tikka masala-type curry ive tasted the dal mahkani is a 3 or 4-bean variety and is much improved over the previous chefs version great samosas and aloo vegetable varieties very importantly the buffet console is boiling hot so all of the food is steaming hot and remains hot on your plate several minutes after you sit down at your table this is a huge detail that can make or break an indian buffet mt everest nails it - keep it up! business seems better than ever which is a good sign that im not the only one who feels like this food has gotten really good typical to an indian lunch buffet the fresh-baked naan and roti are complimentary but the whole wheat roti is especially good here - one would expect it to come out traditionally thin and flat but the mt everest version can be mistaken for a puffy naan bread - a nice surprise whole wheat roti has taken the place of white basmati rice in my indian lunch dietbuffet plates and bowls are clean and shiny water glasses are refilled constantly every single visit finished plates are picked up quickly overall service is great my only warning is you may smell like indian food for the rest of the afternoon so if you are on your way to an important meeting in a small office space maybe bring a change of clothing if you are self-conscious about that kind of thing i guess this is proof that when you eat the lunch buffet at mt everest you are immersed in a cauldron of indian deliciousnessgo now and get it while its hot! ive waited this long to write a review because if i really care about a place i want to make sure its right before friends go try it for the first time (see my cravin cajun review) went there for a lunch buffet and was greeted by a very nice gentleman for the buffet they had a few chicken dishes as well as lentils samosas saag paneer sweet rice and regular basmati rice chicken 65 was spicy and flavorful but nothing too crazy since it was covered in chili peppers the chicken tandori was good but a little on the dry side the chicken makahni was very flavorful and wasnt too creamy their masala chai was very good and nan bread was excellent i was a little disappointed in the saag panner because there was a lack of paneer i had 2 scoops of it and only managed to get 2 small pieces but good thing they didnt overload it with heavy cream though for dessert they had watermelon oranges and rice pudding i had the rice pudding and it was on the thick side aside from the lack of panner and tandori chicken this place is good and i will be going back four stars for meeting my expectations based on other yelperswe were not extremely hungry i ordered the chicken tandoori tiki (hope i got that right as i dont have my handy-dandy asian indian food guide close by) and my wife ordered the okra which comes with basmati rice we also ordered garlic nan and for a specialty beverage the mango lassi; a mango-yogurt drink ill say up front; everything was very good and the mango drink was very much like what we drink brasilian style mixing papaya mango or passion fruit with various forms of yogurt ice cream or condensed milk i bet ive passed this place twenty five times over the past few years when in vegas on business the building is old looking near the bus stop at the front of an older strip center and in an older section of west vegas but once you walk inside see a relatively nice interior and see the many regulars we saw youre probably going to have the same high level of confidence we hadwhile service is stereotypical-etchnic restaurant-slow and spotty the food does deliver it will never be as good as homemade if you cook indian at home but then as a brasilian family we rarely find stateside restaurants that meet our standards thats to be expected but having enjoyed indian cuisine over the years im comfortable recommending this restaurant   ive added mt everest to my black book of off-strip restaurants if its good enough for the many indian clients i saw there tonight then im sure itll be good enough for you remember that indian clients could go anywhere in town but there was a good number of couples and foursomes dining in tonight this alone told us it must have passed their test for authentic and good-enough-food/preparation quality to compete with their own home cooked mealsso as they say in vegas im in at least for this indian restaurant this is by far my favorite place for indian food-and ive been to many places all over the city the food here is comforting full of delicious spices and nicely priced the entrees come with delectable basmati rice which you usually have to order separately at other places and the naan-the fluffiest  softest pieces of heaven! the buffet has a good selection of tasty things and its always different so you get to try everything the owner is so personable and nice we come here at least once a month (if not more often) and will continue to do so! love this place!! a colleague and i changed our business lunch venue to mount everest today - and im sooooo glad we did!i love indian food - and havent had any in a while other than the boil-in-a-pouch variety from trader joes so i jumped at the chance to try a place in town i hadnt been to before just pulling up and waiting outside the aroma was so enticing - i could tell good things awaitedof course since we were there for lunch - we got the buffet as someone who primarily eats vegetarian/vegan i was immediately impressed with the number of veggie dishes offered - and i loved the fact that they separated the meat dishes into a different station all together everything i loaded up my plate with was delish!  from the basmati rice dal veggie korma samosas and pakoras - everything was outstanding the service was super kind and prompt too!  ill be back - with my husband in tow next time! this was a nice little find off the strip we came for the lunch buffet which was $1099/person buffet items:vegetable korma yellow daal chana masala vegetable samosa sweet rice basmati rice vegetable pakora chicken tandoori chili chicken chicken makhani chicken curry goat curry and the best part was that they had my favorite gulab jamun!! the chicken curry was very flavorful it had a great balance of creaminess and spices it also contained big chunks of chicken which is what most people tend to skimp on (abundance of protein is always a plus in a buffet dish) i was surprised that they had goat curry (gamey stuff is not my cup of tea so this one i did not try) the gulab jamun were little balls of perfection service: our server was very attentive and quick to refill our glass of wateri subtracted a star b/c although the gulab was legit they only had the gulab and rice pudding for dessert there was no mango pudding or the carrot halwa the sweet carrot dessert but i guess you cant have everything i also wasnt a fan of their naan that they offered a good naan has a little bit of crispiness and some flavor this naan had no flavor whatsoever and was very thick and heavy it was more of a pita than a naan                   for $1099 i would come again their $11 lunch buffet is amazing! truly an amazing deal and youre really getting wonderful food at such a great price when i arrived a few minutes after my friend we already had a basket of fresh naan and waters the naan was fluffy tasty crispy and just so scrumptiousthe selection was awesome!! the dishes that stood out for me were the basmati rice vegetable korma (vegetables in creamy sauce) vegetable samosa (baked pastry with spiced potato mix) and tandoori chicken (roasted chicken marinated with spices) my absolute favorite dish had to be the chicken makhani (chicken in creamy tomato based gravy); oh my goodness it was so so delicious! amazing flavor and it went well with everything the naan rice and even the samosas! i really liked the samosas as well because the pastry was extremely tasty and wonderfully crunchy the potato mixture inside was also delightful we also tried the chicken curry and goat curry both prepared with the respective meats tomatoes and spices good but overshadowed by the amazing makhani! the aloo baingan (eggplant with potatoes) was tasty and prepared very well but not something i loved the last item i tried was the chili chicken (chicken with garlic green chili and onion) but i didnt like it; plus it was way too spicy for meservice was really great too! our waters were refilled quickly and frequently we also received a naan refill promptly i was extremely pleased with the whole experience! this is seriously great food and i cant wait to go back! this place is absolutely amazing before i get to the food i want to say how nice the waiter was i think he was the ownera son and he was so nice and funny he just came over and talked to us and wanted to see how our food was and if we were doing okay and now the food! we ordered the chicken tikka masala chicken jal frezi and dal tarka with basmati rice for the main course all were very tasty and the chicken was so tender for dessert we got the sweet balls and the rice pudding omg both were soo good! oh and of course the garlic naan was amazing! i definitely recommend this place! a little underwhelmed by the much-hyped chicken tikka masala ordered take out added on the garlic naan and galub jamon specified a spice level of 5/10 for my tikka and order was out in 10 minutes flat with a large side of basmati ricechicken tikka masala was a good size for the $13 price tag which included the rice garlic naan was worth the upcharge: delicious soft and flavorful with a garlic scent that wafted through my car as i drove home my disappointment came when i finally tried my entree for a spice level of 5 i tasted absolutely no spice and the sauce had a sweetness to it that i am not familiar with it wasnt necessarily bad but the dish didnt have the kick to it i was craving chicken in dish was in large chunks sauce was a smidge on the thin sidebased on other reviews im going to have to come back for the lunch buffet and reevaluate after talking about indian food with doriee d and andrew c we decided to check this place out the next day for their lunch buffet which runs from 11 am to 3 pm daily i usually like to order off the menu at places like this but for some reason it seems like indian places in vegas prefer to do buffet only for lunch after seeing a bunch of positive friends reviews of this place we figured it was a fairly safe and solid choicegiven the time we arrived id say the buffet was still fairly full since the lunch buffet ends at 3 pm however we never saw it refilled while we were there on my first plate i tried a little bit of everything which meant i had a pretty full plate to work through the stand outs were the curry chicken tandoori chicken and chili chicken which had a little kick to it the veggie samosa and sweet basmati rice were okand are probably an acquired taste fresh naan was brought to our table and it was warm and delicious! not burnt old or cold like some other places after the first plate i was already pretty full and just got seconds of the chicken dishes i likedwe wanted to try their milky balls =p for dessert but they were all gone by the time we were done eating so we had to settle for the sweet rice pudding instead which i believe is called kheer? for $1099 for an ayce buffet the food was decent and i would come back the next time i have a craving for indian food i am surprised mt everest has a higher rating than mint because it is not even close to the same qualitywhen i pulled up i was surprised to see a drive thru but then i realized it was closed and the employees were using it to park their cars upon walking into the restaurant i noticed the buffet in the back corner looking sad and unsanitary i sat down and shortly after we were brought out the papadum and were asked what we wanted to order the papadum and sauces just werent good and to top things off the basket it was in was not cleaned i shouldnt have overlooked this but i did because i was craving indian food i ordered two mango lassis garlic naan malai kofta chicken makhani their speciality and basmati rice the mango lassis were brought out instantly this one was not made well was overly sweet tasted artificial and was not thick enough i was able to stomach mine but my dining partner wanted to send hers back i asked the asian man if we could send it back and he giggled and said no then our indian waiter comes over laughs and says mango lassis our supposed to be sweet and i said i know i have had my a mango lassi before but but this overly sweet he begrudgingly took it back our entrees come and the portions are huge both of the curries had that artificial taste and reminded me of curry at a food court the chicken in the chicken makhani was dry and the fat was not trimmed off properly the veggie balls in the malai kofta were extremely hard on the outside and not very moist on the inside the garlic naan was tasty but once again it was brought out in a basket that was not clean the indian food here is mediocre and i question how well things are cleaned,3.9375,16,3641 W Sahara Ave Westside Las Vegas NV 89102
Taj Indian Restaurant,first to arrive for the lunch buffet so the food dint sit for long literally had one of everything (i shouldnt be allowed at buffets) so i got a good sense of what they had to offer the good- pakora: the vegetable (cauliflower) was better than the fish or chicken crispy & well-seasoned- saag paneer: creamy thick & rich but not excessively so- kofta: nice soft texture good flavor well sauced- gulab jamun: not offensively sweet good texture- kheer: same as abovethe just okay- samosas garlic naan basmati rice were fine but unremarkable- watery dishes: chicken curry chicken tikka masala dal raita (would have been much better if the sauce had the consistency of the saag paneer)the wtf?- beef at an indian restaurant?! - no lamb- no spice/heat- bathrooms are kinda retro but not scaryi recently just got back from a trip to india (jaipur rajasthan) and the dishes listed under good above were comparable at less than $10 it was a great deal and will be back,3.0,1,1256 S Park St Bay Creek Madison WI 53715
Royal Taj,authentic indian classics plus great service being the novice that i am the waitress was patient and took the time to explain the menu as well the heat levels and made great recommendations according to my tastesroyal taj serves tandoori curry samosas and fragrant basmati rice  one nice thing is they offer many complete dinners that include dinner dessert and indian coffee for one price good-quality food and very consistent  my group enjoyed the chicken tikka masala lamb karahi mutter paneer (peas and homemade cheese in a coconut curry sauce) with basmati rice and aloo paratha (naan with potatoes and peas)  their vegetable samosas are pretty tasty too!service could be much better  we had to wait awhile to order the food dessert and then again for the ticket  btw portions are pretty slim but the flavors all but make up for the small portions went for the lunch buffet the garlic naan was pretty much the best i had in phoenix they had basmati rice daal palak paneer (saag paneer) potatoes and mushrooms paneer chicken makhani another type of chicken( which was the best dish) and tandoori chicken(not really great)over all a really good indian buffet in the phoenix area will probably go back again perhaps one would consider me spoiled high maintenance or snobby in regards to my standards for good food (and possibly in regards to several other personal attributes but thats besides the point) having lived in boston for many years a city with greater ethnic diversity than phoenix i became accustomed to delicious and authentic indian food i had my pick from a number of excellent choices in somerville cambridge brighton south end and the back baybut here in phoenix the pickings are slim but good news! i have found my spot for indian food in the valley - royal taj it is located in a shopping plaza in a shady-ish area of tempe but dont let that deter you from savoring the delicious flavors of india the restaurant is a true family affair if youve ever had the pleasure of knowing indian parents youll just love the owners service is fast and friendly and the atmosphere is homey youll hear the main proprietor calling out your order across the room to the kitchen and soon enough youll have amazing food on your tabletheir menu is excellent with a wide array of naan tandoori masala curries biryani and saag i thought their mango lassi was excellent - not too thick not too thin and bursting the sweet taste of mango for dinner they start you with these spiced crisps and dipping sauces which surprisingly did an excellent job of whetting my appetite the garlic naan was very good - i ate the entire order on my own! we ordered tandoori chicken and kahari chicken the tandoori chicken arrived on a sizzling dish and was just beautiful i thought its flavors were great and the half-serving was more than enough for one person the karahi chicken was delicious and had just the right spicy kick the basmati rice was aromatic plentiful and perfectly done after dinner they serve gulab jamun - sweet sticky fried dough-like balls yum! even my leftovers were amazing two days later! next time ill definitely try a masala and maybe come in for the lunch buffet i still miss the diversity and options that boston presents but i have to say i am very happy to have found a really great place here in tempe royal taj is just what i was looking for [3 stars by phx comparison and 2 overall] my quest for indian food in the valley continues call me spoiled but i have had some great indian food (on and off a buffet) and everything after that is relative i also learned to make a few of my favorite dishes for those times i lived in the boonies and couldnt easily get my indian fix craving indian food for sunday brunch i recall a restaurant that many of my friends have tried and enjoyed royal taj popped in just after noon its not busy the ambiance is warm and cozy i request a booth and decide on the buffet it is small but contains the standard fare basmati rice saag paneer a lentil (dal) dish a chickpea dish veggie pakora masala paneer chicken tikka masala chicken vindaloo and tandori chicken a sign above the buffet says that garlic naan will be served at the table picking up my large plate and put rice at the center and put a little of just about everything around the outside to try as i served the saag paneer i noticed i didnt see the chunks of paneer i often do with this dish (maybe they blend it in) plate full and serving myself up a cup of warm chai (included at the buffet) i sat back at my booth shortly there after my naan arrives hot and fresh i pull apart a piece crispy on the outside and soft interior the garlic not as prominent as i would have liked but as i would find out soon the naan was the main redeeming quality about royal taj five stars for the naan!! the rest of the food was lack luster not bad just not that good even by phx standards the pakora were stale and the masalas thin my relative favorites from this buffet were the chicken vindaloo the saag paneer and the chickpea dish these were seasoned well although i missed the chunks of paneer in the saag they had 2 of my most favorite desserts on the buffet kheer (sweet rice) and the gulab jamun (pastry balls in a cardamon honey syrup) the kheer appeared strangely thick but i didnt think much when serving it when i finally got to the table and had a bitedid they use yogurt or buttermilk? there was a strange cultured milk flavor that was not typical of most kheer needless to say this was the first time i didnt finish my kheer (when often i go for seconds) the gulab jamun on the other hand were great homemade soft and melted in your mouth 5 stars for the galub jamun the buffet was @ $11 with tax which is about average but high considering the quality was just barely ok my search continueswhich several other places in the valley yet to try i doubt i will be back i went here the other night after a nearly 18 month absence (not because of anything wrong with this place but because i had graduated from law school and wasnt in the area as often) and am glad i did! i remembered why i love this place: the service is friendly the food is good the prices are fair it wasnt very busy on a thursday evening so i had the pick of any table i wanted one of the owners bustled over with water right away and took my drink order i wanted a blue himalayan beer but she told me that they were out but she made a suggestion of a similar beer the flying horse and it was prefect with the food i ordered garlic naan basmati rice and chicken vindaloo the flavors are all great but heres what i love about this place: when i say indian hot please they bring it to me indian hot she only raised one eyebrow and repeated back indian hot? and when i nodded she smiled and away she went i loved the spice on my vindaloo and the beer that she suggested worked well to cool me down as i was eating i love that the heat doesnt hide the amazing flavors in their dishes the portions are generous and i had a good dinner and a large lunch out of my meal the lamb saag is also excellent and i have had their biryanis in the past as well this is a solid place to go and i am glad to have rediscovered it after a long time away this is by far the best indian cuisine in the valley -and i have been to several trying to find a good once since moving here 5 years ago!  they are hardly busy -so you get right in and sit to eat immediately -great for a work day lunch as it is quick!i have only attended during the lunch buffet which is always phenomenal!  they always have the following on their lunch buffet menu (i frequent often!)chicken tikka masala -my fav chunks of white meet in butter/tomato saucetandoori chicken -chicken grilled in a kiln with onions -moist and yummypaneer masala  -goat cheese cubed in the same great butter/tomato saucethe fried veggie crips are delish! (cant remember the formal name)basmati rice (so tasty you could eat it by itself!)kheer --best rice pudding ever! (besides moms! :-)gulab jamun -little donut hole type treat soaking in a light syrup -yum!and this is a small sampling of what is on the buffet!service is fabulous and they are very friendly -but bewareif you come in often enough -they treat you like family and will remember your fav drink and offer to bring you one when they greet you! royal taj is the best indian food there is i didnt like indian food until i came here with my wife a few years ago this is one of our favorite restaurants of all time we have tried indian food all over town and in a few other cities and they all fall short when compared to royal taj royal taj has the best basmati rice their garlic naan is always fresh and looked forward to every dish is amazing their marsala and their korma are what we order the most the sauces and gravies are rich and flavorful the paneer tiki is a wonderful dish as is the saag paneer as they both have amazing paneer cheese with a wonderful flavor and perfect texture they have a full bar and great indian beers as well as other import beers this is real indian food made by a nice indian family they even adjust the spiciness of each dish to your order  we always stick with the medium spice  if you go to the lunch buffet everything will be of a mild spice but you can always order an entree for lunch instead of the buffet if you want it spicier  my wife is a vegetarian and im a big meat eater and we both have allot to choose from here  long story short if you like indian food royal taj is for you  if you dont like indian food royal taj is also for you because any other indian food you have had probably paled in comparison to royal taj  royal taj will make you a fan of indian food,4.0,8,6245 W Chandler Blvd Ste 1 Chandler AZ 85226
Tamba Indian Cuisine & Lounge,every time ive been to vegas i have been wanting to try out this restaurant so this past weekend when i was in vegas i dragged my partner there he had the tikka masala and i had the chicken tandoori sharing  basmati rice and naan bread my meal was utter perfection the service was adequate we were not in any sort of hurry my only complaint is that i wished the buffet option was available for dinner i will definitely go there the next time i am in vegas we had a really lovely experience!  the ambiance is tasteful and our service was very friendly and helpful  he politely explained the items on the menu since we proved to be indian food dummies  tamba does not open until 6:00  parking can be a bit confusing  there is a lot behind mcdoanldsthere is a booth with a parking attendantsays $5  we told them we had a dinner reservation at tamba and he let us right in  no $5 necessarywe tried the cheese appetizer served with spicy mint sauce tamarind sauce and crackers  it was really good!  we had lamb korma chicken tikka masala eggplant 2 types of naan and basmati rice  the sauces on the chicken and lamb were excellent but the meat was dry in both  the eggplant was out of this world  everything had great flavor  i would definitely go back and im recommending it to all  we spent $100 for 4 with all the aforementioned and 2 large beers this place is an exotic gem hidden inside the crappiness that is the hawaiian marketplace walking through this rundown strip mall and into a mysteriously empty building and up the escalator i did not expect to find a beautiful atmosphere of indian decor i really regret ordering take out instead of staying to dine in but my friends and i all picked up food from various places and we wanted to eat togetheri was immediately greeted by a gentleman who gave me helpful suggestions on all of their vegan-friendly items this made ordering very easy for me while there were several options i decided on the following:kali dal (slow cooked black lentils and spices) http://supr/7wv21zveggie samosas (about 5 or 6 pieces) http://supr/2wadc9tandoori roti - whole wheat flat breadbasmati riceone sad thing about take out is that the presentation is not as elegant however it smelled good it tasted good and i was happy my friends were definitely peering over at my food i even gave away one of my tasty veggie samosas for the $33 that i paid i had a full vegan meal plus enough leftovers for a second meal which tasted just as good two evenings later order the chicken korma it is to die for garlic or plain naan with yellow or basmati rice and you are set! tucked away on the strip in the hawaiian marketplace area this is a hidden gem  so ill admit it was my first time having indian food  luckily i was meeting friends who had some knowledge about it and helped me out on what to have  we went family style so we were able to taste a little bit of everything we ordered  first i want to say the service and staff here were amazing  my water glass never went less than half full  kudos! our waiter was very helpful also in helping us decide what to get  i would say he went above and beyond! to start off we tried the vegetable samosas and vegetable pakoras  the samosas reminded me of an empanada except stuffed with potato and peas  accompanied with the sauces these were great! the pakoras were good also but a little too much breading  for the main course we went with the chicken tikka masala  the tomato curry sauce over the chicken was good! i scooped this over the basmati rice and was very pleased   as for the chicken and rice dishes there was plenty to be shared between 3 people and couldnt imagine eating this all myself we even had much leftover! the garlic naan came out warm flavorful and perfect  overall i was delighted for this to be my first indian food experience this place is excellent in many ways husband went exploring the strip while i of course slept in he discovered tamba and brought me their card knowing that i love indian food we walked from the mgm at about 9:00 which is a pretty weird scene the mall is empty except for this restaurant the restaurant was about 3/3 full with more than 1/2 of the people eating there indian or pakistani we ordered on basmati rice 2 naans 1 began bharta and 1 matter paneer all excellent literally the best roast eggplant curry i have ever had they roast the eggplant in their tandoori oven which adds a smoky flavor the texture and heat were just right  paneer was perfectly madethe portions are more than twice the size of what i normally get here in san francisco/bay areapricing a bit higher but it is vegas and 10-1200 a dish is not unreasonable waiter and hostess and bus staff were all very nice and efficient,4.333333333333333,6,Hawaiian Marketplace 3743 S Las Vegas Blvd  Ste 205 The Strip Las Vegas NV 89109
Indian Maharaja Palace,ive had better elsewhere however there arent a whole lot of cheap indian buffet places that ive seen around here there werent very many people during lunch rush and only one patron was indian so either the food is not up to par or they didnt go that daythe food was decent not much selection but the stuff i picked was tasty they bring you naan which i liked and i had a mango lassa which i get every time i eat indian buffet i had the usual chicken tandoori curry basmati rice and biryani it was definitely filling though a bit spicy for my taste id prob go back if i was desperately craving indian food and its close to school so thats a plus,2.0,1,5775 West Bell Rd Ste 5 Glendale AZ 85308
OM Restaurant,oh my gosh! yuuum!we went here after work today and it was so delicious! all the food is prepped and if you want it spicier they will make it to order for you! garlic naan is so good they literally make the dough when you order it and cook it in an industrial tandoor right there for you to seethe food is delicious the staff is super nice and friendly i ordered a 2 entree plate with chicken tikka masala as both entrees which they were more than happy to do and basmati rice for $699 this was an amazing deal!my girlfriend ordered lam vindaloo as both entrees and basmati rice you can choose rice or naan but you can also get an extra order of it on the side for $199 and its huge probably before being cut about the size of a small pizza plus its amazingly deliciousif you want quick delicious well priced indian cuisine this is the place for you! we will definitely be coming back here and i suggest you all go! my favorite in las vegas has been mint for last 4 years i have tried many of the other popular indian restaurants and none of them have come closer to mint until last month one of my friend recommended this location to me and said that food is cooked in front of you and the prices are reasonable i bookmarked this location on yelp and i finally went for it one dayits located on a plaza by 215 and eastern this area is always busy with many restaurants in the location so parking might be a small issue the restaurant is not lavish like many other indian restaurants they have tv where some indian music is played but over all its atmosphere is more like  robertos the owners are nepalese and the food is mainly north indian with some that have obvious nepalese fusion to it i always get two curries naan and basmati rice at this location so far i have tried chicken tikka masala palak panner (spinach w/ cottage cheese my fav) chilli chicken chicken karai and their garlic naan i think this restaurant has the most authentic indian flavor of any restaurant and the food is cooked fresh in front of you this prices are also very low compared to taj and mint and its an excellent place for take out meals when i first went to this restaurant they were running a promotion of 20% off the entire bill for only month of march this made the deals even more special i also saw that they do deliveries now i highly recommend that you stop by to try out their sampler plates (thali) which come with 1-2 entrees and 1-3 side dishes they also have groupon and amazon/living social dealsoverall (5/5) great place ive never had indian food before but i came here because a friend told me its really good and i work near by i got butter chicks and hit mango chicken and basmati rice and samosa(like a potato egg roll lol) they were all very good the mango chicken is really spicy though so be careful haha but i will be back for sure butter chicken and the rice was my favorite,5.0,3,9400 S Eastern Ave 106A Southeast Las Vegas NV 89123
Origin India Restaurant & Bar,after two visits this is now our favorite indian restaurant in las vegas  04/07 prior to our first visit i found a 2/1 coupon celebrating their first anniversary so we decided to give this restaurnt  it is located in a small nondescript strip mall  the owners have obviously spent considerable dollars on the interior our waiter served us papadum accompanied by tamarind and cilantro sauces  we decided to try the high end of the menu sharing orders of jhinga dum sunerhri (queen prawns simmered in coconut milk yogurt and a touch of cashew nut sauce) and goshet rajawri (boneless lamb cooked in spices tomatoes egg yogurt and a cashew paste)  entrees included basmati rice a choice of naan or paratha (we tried both) and lentil side dishes  this was probably the best indian meal we have had in las vegas 09/07 we returned to find the menu has been largely revised with many new items appearning and prices increased  complimentary papadum was served with tamarind and cilantro dipping sauces shortly after we were presented with menus  the waiter convinced us to try the evenings special appetizer a crepe made with corn homemade cheese and potato which proved to be an excellent choice  our first entre was murg chili milli kebab - tandori chicken marinated in indian spices and accompanied by an east asian sauce the chicken was amazingly moist tender and very flavor-ific  our second entre was baingan dahiwala - roasted eggplant cooked with yogurt and onions in a cashew sauce  this dish was not as smooth textured as similar dishes served elsewhere but was very tasty   menu prices may initially seem high but most entrees include a side salad choice of naan or paratha basmati rice and a lentil dipping sauce - we chose black everything was fantastic while service was very attentive without be intrusive12/07 update to include 3 additional visitswe were served housemade papadum with mint and tamarind sauces followed by a complimentary sweet potato salad that managed to be both spicy and cooling  my wife ordered the lamb chop masala - small tender chops that had been cooked in masala sauce  my entre was chicken makhani aka butter chicken - melt-in-your mouth pieces of chicken cooked in a creamy tomato sauce  both entrees included basmati rice a black lentil dipping sauce naan and an unadorned salad  i signed up online for the restaurants vip club and used a 2/1 entre coupon that was emailed to me shortly before we departed for this trip  we were the only customers a saturday afternoon so i suspect luncheon hours may be curtailed in the future  we each ordered chicken kebab roll - grilled tandoor chicken wrapped in a romali roll  lunches include a choice of ice tea or soda we chose the ice tea  the flavor was truly amazing but the amount of food was more than we needed  the cost of the meal is net of a $10 coupon received after i provided online feedback on our experience in september  we were served complimentary papadum with mint and tamarind sauces orders of chicken chettinad - boneless thigh pieces cooked with pounded southern spices with a hint of coconut and lamb rajwari - boneless lamb cooked with spices tomatoes yogurt and a touch of cashew  both dishes included a vegetable dish naan rice and salad  we used a printable 2/1 coupon that had been emailed to members of the restaurants vip club) we were warmly greeted by raja the owner/manager and his excellent wait staff  raja told us the chef would like to treat us to a sample of their soon to be released new menu  we started off with papadum accompanied by tamarind and mint sauces which are always excellent  this was followed by panipuri a popular street snack comprised of a round hollow puri fried crisp and filled with bits of meat potato and greens balanced on a thin shot glass filled with tamarind spices and sparkling water this appetizer is designed to increase ones appetite as if mine needed stimulation     our next surprise was a tandoori sampler of lamb chicken and shrimp with fresh sprouts  it was an amazing appetizer in terms of beauty tenderness and flavor we were asked how spicy would we like our entrees i prefer spicy and ann likes medium so we compromised and requested medium - go figure we again were the recipient of rajas generosity when his bartender presented us with glasses of ginger ale made from fresh ginger and lime mixed with sparkling water these proved to be an amazing complement to our entrees of chicken makahani (butter chicken) and lamb rajwari  our entrees included black lentils naan basmati rice and a small salad  service and the food continue to be amazing  on exiting we went to the bar to complement the bartender and he gave us a small sample of his black cherry martini - wow!  should i ever end up on death row this will probably be the last meal i request  ($2495 other 5 forks) my sister and i used the $20 for $40 promotion last night at origin india it was my second time eating there but my first time since going vegan (my sister is vegan too) we had pretty much decided on what we were going to order when my sister asked our server senad a few questions about butter meat broth etc he said youre vegan? we have a vegan menu and took our menus and returned with a comprehensive two-page all vegan menu my sister and i were pumped! the only problem with the vegan menu is there are no prices! that really annoyed me we asked senad what the prices were and he said something along the lines of oh the prices are just like the regular menu not good enough it seems so strange to go to the trouble of making up a whole vegan menu and then not provide prices the food came out quickly we ordered 3 vegan samosas ($7) and they were fantastic the rest of the food came out shortly thereafter we ordered baingan bhartha ($11) aloo gobi ($11) and bhindi masala ($11) since none of those dishes come with rice we ordered pulao rice ($4) which is basmati rice with saffron we also ordered roti ($2) everything was delicious the bhindi masala (an orka dish) was my favorite (i think my sisters too) it had a lot of different intense flavors the baingan bartha (eggplant) was really good too it had a little bit of a spicy kick the aloo gobi (curried potatoes and cauliflower) was also really good i am a sucker for potatoes over all it was a great meal the priceless menu was annoying and senad was an overbearing server but the food and the rest of the wait staff made up for the shortcomings excellent food! vegan friendly make sure to ask for the vegan menu when eating at a restaurant most americans would classify as ethnic i judge it firstly by the patrons  if the people dining there are of the same national origin as the food i know it is going to be authentic  this was the case at origin india last night  the majority of diners were indeed indian  my roommate and i went last night  as we walked in we were greeted by a lovely hostess who was very friendly and seemed surprised that i had made a reservation  hey i saw the option on the site and gave it a shot  a reservation really was not necessary though  there were plenty of open tables in a restaurant that from the outside looks small  just because there were plenty of tables available does not mean there were no diners  there were several tables being used  as we were seated towards the back of the restaurant i looked around and quickly felt relaxed  it was dimly lit and i could hear indian music playing softly in the background  on the table was very heavy silverware and giant fancy folded cloth napkinsour server was very attentive  he came by frequently to ask if we were ready to order and again to check if we were enjoying our dining experience  we were  i ordered the chicken tikka makhani in the entree size (smaller portion served with rice)  my roommate ordered the family size home style chicken curry  we both ordered naan  i got the wild mushroom naan with truffle oil while he ordered the fresh garlic naan  it was not unlike a good fresh pizza crust  it was fluffy with a slight chew  very good for sopping up the left over sauce from the meal  my makhani was good  the chicken was very tender  the sauce has a great spice  the basmati rice was light and airy  amazing  the chicken curry was good as well  the sauce had a strong tomato flavor  it was not quite like spaghetti sauce but reminiscent of though it had a curry taste to it as well  what made the curry good was the fresh cilantro added on top  it was refreshingi am going to give origin india four stars today though 35 would be most accurate  the service could not have been better  the food was very  i enjoyed it thoroughly  it is  however priced high for the amount of food you receive  i was not starving when i got home but i was not full either  for $20 a person i expect to be full upon leaving and have leftovers to take home as well  this was not the case  had it not been for my groupon offer i would not have eaten here  for this i must demote them to a 35 star rating i really dont understand where all the hype is coming from while it was decent it is nowhere near 4 star status  i thought that the prices were pretty expensive during lunch  we went on a saturday lunch and they didnt offer any specials except for the $30 prix fixe meal for two  the food was okay but i expected a fuller richer flavor as the items seemed a bit bland to me for indian food  one of the chicken items tasted like orange chicken from panda express and the other chicken dish used so much yogurt in it that it completely drowned out the spices not to mention the impending bloating (dang asian lactose intolerance genes!)  the rice wasnt aromatic like other basmati rice that ive had and the naan was a bit too thick for my tastes as i like em thin and crispyi checked in on yelp and received a free appetizer but the waiter gave me a little bit of flak for it because they said it wasnt on their system  i was not about to pay $15 for 3 small pieces of dry lamb chop  he finally conceded after tasting some of my chinese haggling skillsi probably wouldnt come back theres a whole bunch of other options in vegas to eat at this is my go-to indian place  they have deals on groupon most weekdays--$15 for $30 worth of food  thats more than enough during lunch when they have their lunch specials: 2 appetizers 2 main dishes and 2 desserts  during dinner i use that to order my usual: veggie samosas chicken tikka makhani basmati rice and 1 side or dessert  very filling!  the samosas here are well made and not as greasy as other indian restaurants make them  the manager is a very nice guy!  he remembers us each time we visit  i had bangs then no bangs between 2 visits and he didnt want to say welcome back! to my boyfriend because he thought maybe he brought in another girl!!  i found it hilarious  so the manager has your back haha  the wait staff is very prompt w/taking your order refilling drinks and getting the check to youpricey w/o deals from yelp or groupon but still worth it either way,4.0,6,4480 Paradise Rd Ste 1200 Eastside Las Vegas NV 89169
Taj Mahal Indian Cuisine,i had planned to have thai this past tuesday (10/28) when i met an acquaintance at work who told me hed been inundated with phone calls all day from friends and relatives wishing him an indian happy new year  (10/29- time in india is 12 hours ahead)  since i had wanted indian cuisine for some time i decided id hold off on having thai and go for indian that night  i first thought of going to royal taj on broadway but i wasnt looking forward to the slow service  ive wanted to try taj mahal ever since a coworker told me how good the samosas were there though she had admitted that shes never had samosas before  i figured what better time to try a new indian restaurant than on their new year!i noticed one other couple besides me that night and they were waiting for their entrees  i greeted the host jimmy who turned out to be one of three siblings that ran the restaurant  he was very welcoming and we exchanged happy divalis as he led me to my table  i liked the subtle lighting in the main dining area where most of the light came modern indian music videos displayed on tv  i thought the yellow curtain upon which a silver-studded likeness of the taj mahal served as a nice alternative to a regular door- this apparently led to the restrooms which i wouldnt find out until the next day when i took my mom to have dinner there againi decided on having an app for dinner- samosa with channa chat: a crisp vegetable patty consisting of potatoes and peas with channa masala a dish made with chickpeas/garbanzo beans onions tomatoes garlic garam masala cilantro and spices (turmeric cumin peppers and coriander to name a few)  waiting for my entree i munched on a papadum with chutneys of mint and tamarind and chatted with the couple next to me who expounded the details of the celebration of divali a winter harvest festival honoring the return of good lord ram from exile and his triumph over demon-king ravan with fireworks flowers worship and with sweets  i chose to do my part in the celebration by having rasmalai and gulab jamun later on that night :di found the samosa quite delightful with the channa masala (aka chana or chole as in chole bhature) but it would be equally delicious without the garnish  for dessert i couldnt decide between the gulab jamun a favorite made with homemade cheese cubes fried and swimming in sugar syrup and the rasmalai also made of homemade cheese but not fried and cooked instead with condensed milk and rosewater sugar syrup sprinkled with crushed pistachios so i had both!  jimmy was very accomodating as i asked my usual questions regarding my food allergies and he happily obliged me with the details of their lunch buffets- from 11a to 2:30p $8 each day with differing 5 veggie entrees 3 meat entrees 2 breads (plus your choice of plain or garlic naan which is served to you at the table) basmati rice a dessert and the usual accompaniment of 4 or 5 chutneys  if menu options do not satisfy you the kitchen staff will gladly oblige as long as your requests are of northern india origin- it is a punjabi restauranti enjoyed my experience here so much i returned again with mom the next night  mom was open to going there not knowing much of indian cuisine bec i had brought home keema naan (stuffed with minced lamb) which she enjoyed  since she and i like lamb i ordered the lamb rogam josh a tomato-based dish curry-like with onions garlic chilis and spices  i had hoped to speak with jimmy to get his lamb suggestions but as it turned out he was busy helping out in the kitchen  (he actually cooked our dish and remembered speaking of making the lamb jalfraize too late into the preparation of the rogan josh dish)  $13 price tag didnt include rice which was disappointing since udupi cafe and other restaurants ive visited in the valley do so i ordered garlic naan  again we were served papadum and chutneys while we waited for our food  as usual mom thought everyone elses selections looked delicious as they were brought to their tables  they certainly sounded terrific- sizzling chicken tandoori and a salmon dish i cannot recall  the dishes arrived but mom did not enjoy the samosa chana chat for she had found it too spicy (i thought it was perfect!)  it wasnt too late to alter the spice level of the lamb dish which also did not appeal to her  i found it to be good if a little too gamey  i only had a taste since the samosa app was very filling  at least mom enjoyed the wonderful garlic naani will definitely be back to try the lunch buffet ok im a huge indian food fan i have been to almost all of them in the city at least once my current favorite has been flavors of india on 16th street & cambell because it is near work and they make an awesome chicken korma let me state for the record that i never ever ever get the buffet which is pretty standard at most indian places in the valley aside from buffet-phobia i am a pretty big chili head i like hot in any shape and form this means i need to order off the menu and ask for it spicy i typically order indian spicy or the hottest you make it so i jumped off the 202 a bit early the other day because of traffic and headed north on scottsdale imagine my surprise to see taj mahal there at mckellips so close to my home stomping grounds i immediately made a mental note to try ittoday was that day i popped in to grab lunch take out for my wife and i the place was completely empty and there in the back was the requisite buffet (i didnt get close enough to it to see what it held) i sat at the bar and ordered the chicken tikka masala (mild rating 0) for her and the chicken vindaloo (as a 10) for me as well as an order of garlic naanlet me say i was impressed the chicken tikka was on par with any i have tried in the valley the garlic naan was better than most but i think the delhi palace in tempe has that beat the basmati rice was ok probably the least impressive part of the meal i really prefer it with a nice mix of crunchy bottom scrapings however! the real winner was my chicken vindaloo i am in love finally a place that actually brings the heat a 10 means 10 it was exactly the level of spiciness i crave and have yet to get in an indian restaurant in az i think i might still have a little endorphin high from it right now the flavor was phenomenal as well a nice rich flavor i like vindaloo because its not quite as heavy as some of the creamier ones and this one did not dissapoint a crisp deep flavor with a beautiful slow burn spicinessi am definitely a regular now in fact i am going to bring some fellow chili-head friends next weekend oh they also have a nice selection of indian beers more than is normally found at similar places you cant go crazy with the spice without some refreshing beers on hand right?if you like spicy or even just like indian food pop in and give it a go i will cry myself to sleep at night snuggling my plush habanero if this place goes out of business because of people not knowing about it ;)oh the prices off the menu were very affordable if my wife liked spicy (or vice versa) we could have easily split the one or the other $13 entree and been full my pops and i decided we were in the mood for indian food and hit the town looking for a hot spot  the place we were looking for we couldnt find so i yelped and found this indian treatthe place was dead when we walked in we were the only table  the owner greeted us and sat us (he was very congenial)  we explained how we found the place and he was eager for us to try his indian cuisine and we were happy to oblige  our server greeted us and took our drink orders while we surveyed the menuwe took our servers recommendations and ordered the following:chicken pakorasgarlic naanbaingan bhaartachicken vindaloolamb kormalamb rogan joshrotibasmati riceto start off the chicken pakoras were awesome!!!  like indian chicken nuggets but extremely delicious  i loved adding the tamarind chutney (which i love at all indian restaurants) and shoving these tasty treats into my mouth  yummerz!the rest of the dishes were very good but nothing as good as the pakoras  the lamb rogan josh was very good and had a deep rich indian spice flavor to it  i also really enjoyed their naanthe chicken vindaloo is a more sour dish  not exactly what my palette was looking for but still tasty nonethelessi would definitely go back to this place  the ambiance and hospitality were wonderful and the tvs had on some sort of indian mtv that was really fun to watch  i would recommend this indian restaurant to friends and family and you my fellow yelpers im having a hard time concentrating as the urge to slip into a food nap is overwhelming after the amount of awesome food i ate here  visited this place and i must say that it is my absolute new place to get indian from  now i have not yet had one of the regular dishes but the buffet from 11-2 had me captivated from beginning to end  id have to say its a little hard to locate and definitely not somewhere youd go unless on a dare being located between a big lots and a food citynow i love putting basmati rice under most dishes as filler but this stuff you could eat by itself it was that flavorful they had four chicken dishes though the tandoori tikka masala and vindaloo all had superb flavor that begged me to get seconds even when i didnt need it  the vegetarian choices were not quite as good as the chicken and there didnt seem to be many choices available didnt care as it meant more room for dishes that captivated me  the naan this is the clincher  we ordered the garlic naan and between it being super fresh the right amount of oil and infused with garlic this multiplied the yum factor of everything sopped up with it by a factor of tenthe host was super friendly and made you feel right at home explaining dishes that i was not all that familiar with and letting us know about their online specials and coupons through facebook  the waiter had us topped off with water and soda before we got to the bottom of a glass top notchnow ive been around to a few other indian places in the vicinity most notably delhi palace and if you like that place youll love this,4.25,4,1849 N Scottsdale Rd Tempe AZ 85281
Guru Palace,after reading all the positive reviews i decided to try out the buffet on sunday afternoon  my husband and i loved everything! the quality was spectacular and everything was super fresh  the buffet offers  deliciously seasoned basmati rice (my favorite in phoenix) chicken curry chicken masala pakora palak paneer goat curry salad fruit tandoori chicken chai tea and regular or garlic naan  there were a few other items but i dont remember what they were called  we ordered the garlic naan and it was to die for it was perfectly grilled and had just the right amount of garlic brushed on it  for only $899 it was one hell of a bargain the atmosphere is also very nice with beautiful paintings and decorative fixtures they also play soothing music  we knew the place was going to be good when half of the patrons were inidan i highly recommend this restaurant to anyone on the east valley we will definitely return on the weekends for the buffet!,4.0,1,2048 E Baseline Rd Mesa AZ 85204
Namaste Indian Cuisine,luncheon buffet - i sampled the pakora indian pickles raita tamarind and mint sauces fresh naan basmati rice chicken and lamb curries saag sambar and gajar halwa  we have never dined at an indian buffet in las vegas but it did not compare well to the ones we frequent in connecticut stepped into this place for a pre-show dinner because there was a wait at lotus of siam next door and will definitely be going back for more!for 3 appetizers 2 entrees 2 premium beers and a dessert our bill was $51we had the vegetable pakora onion bahji & paneer naan to start things off while we waited the waiter brought out some popadoms on the house with a sweet sauce and spicy sauce nice for our main courses we had the chicken vindaloo (chicken & potatoes stewed with curry over rice) & chicken biriani(chicken cashew nuts vegetables basmati rice) i enjoyed everything we had and though it was probably a mistake to get 2 fried appetizers the pakora & bhaji were great & the naan bread was soft and tastythe vindaloo for me was perfect it was spicy but not overpowering and the flavors really came through in the sauce along with the tender and juicy chicken it may not be as spicy as some lotus regulars are used to but i thought it was spot onthe only complaint my gf had about her dish was that it could have used more cashews i was skeptical when she ordered the carrot based dessert but was surprised at how good it wasprobably the healthiest dessert you will ever eatthe service was quick and friendly and i hope this place sticks around it didnt seem that busy at 8ish on a tuesdaythough we were surprised to see the mayor and his wife walk through the door and sit at the adjacent booth midway through our meal! the new ownership of namaste improved health department standard as well as stellar reviews and recommendations made me suggest this as the place for a co-workers birthday lunch i shared the yelp link with all and we were waiting with anticipation to partake in a bevy of curries and mop that up with naannamaste is really well done up dark wood paneling soft muted lighting cosy boothsi can see how this place could be the setting for quite the romantic date night (although indian food may not be something you want to be eating on the first few dates!) melque (?) the owner was very very personable she checked up on us multiple times and sang a song (ungforgettable) during lunch yes it was a little strange and hard to talk to my table but she did have a good voice and shes just so sweet now the foodi only ate vegetarian sincei am vegetariana fairly extensive selection at namaste so that was really nice there were the usual salads and chutneys all of which were very fresh the navaratan korma (mixed vegetable curry) was really really good the soft basmati rice with peas also very comforting and the dal makhani was creamy and tasty i wasnt a fan of the uthapam and sambar the uthapam was too sour (i guess the batter fermented a little too long) and im reiterating my usual complaint that no restaurant knows what sambar is in las vegas the aloo gobi and spinach and potato puree were passablewe got a basket of garlic naans that was tasty but rather tough and dry my co-workers enjoyed the carnivorous fare but everyone asked me the same thing when we leftwhen are we going to mount everest again?ill definitely be back as namaste is one of the better buffets in town and the service and ambiance is really top notch 1 star for good curries1 star for ambiance1 star for clean rest roomi have taken stars off forhard basmati riceand the service also heard the waiter and the owner quarreling over some leaves that the waiter wanted to take but was denied,3.5,4,953 E Sahara Ave Eastside Las Vegas NV 89104
Curry Leaf Indian Grill,its interesting seeing some of the reviews on here you would think curry leaf was trying to present itself as an upscale indian food restaurant in a hugely desirable area curry leaf shares a strip mall with a dry cleaners taco bell az hair co and chuck e cheese its a small place with tables to eat in but i imagine most of their business is takeout or the newly available delivery jeff p mentions it just sees as if some random auntie and uncle decided to lease a space and start cooking fast food versions of indian food  first of all i disagree with this and second isnt america founded on the entrepreneurial spirit that promotes local owned businesses?!? curry leaf is owned by a husband/wife duo and i was super stoked at how nice the husband was he answered my questions without prejudice which is rare for me in other indian establishments while i waited for my food we chatted about their business my business and other random chit chat as i was leaving another gentleman came in and the husband sang out hey bob how are you doing today?!? its nice to see that customer service and appreciation are still alive these days i ordered the channa masala bowl with basmati rice and a side of cumin potatoes and i was really impressed the flavor in both dishes was great and had just a little tinge of spicyness the portions were great and for the price of $499 i think an excellent value (lunch price is $499; regularly $699) there are also a couple of really neat things that make this place stand out: they offer deliver and text in service so you can actually text them your order for pickup! i think that is such a cool idea you are texting directly to the husbands phone and then he saves your number so that in the future he knows that its you im pretty sure he remembers every customer the bowls that they use for takeout are very durable and can be used again as tupperware i think this is a super cool idea and adds a little value in a world where we are cattle prodded through life eating out of styrofoam containers in our cars i believe curry leaf has made an attempt to add value to their product and i for one am both impressed and inspired and look forward to a new weekly lunch spot!,5.0,1,4825 E Warner Rd Phoenix AZ 85044
Tandoori Times 2 Indian Bistro,having lived in new delhi as a child for 4 years i have always been on the lookout for a good indian restaurant in the states wherever i have lived (i even found a good one in fort wayne indiana!)  for most indian restaurants the trend is to put out large tubs of curries and tandoori chicken made with ready-made pastes  with pre-made pastes it is impossible to get a fantastic indian meal it must be made with fresh ingredients from scratch (even down to making your own cheese)  it got to the point that i could not scratch that itch for the authentic tasting stuff so i started making it on my own at home  just like mexican food the best stuff is made at home not in the restaurants    however the tandoori times bistro came along in scottsdale and i had finally found my culinary nirvana  then as if prayers were being answered tandoori times 2 came to glendale  their tandoori chicken is exactly as i remembered it at modhi mahals in delhi as is the dal nan mattar paneer    ive read a lot of mixed reviews of tt2 here on yelp ranging from beyond bad to exquisite  i dont understand this maybe because most americans dont know what to expect with indian food because they either think its native american food or theyve never had it in their life before (most americans already know mexican food whether they like it or not)  one thing about food from india is that it is an ancient cuisine going back thousands of years  mexican food as we know it (tacos enchiladas tostadas etc) is relatively new  why is this important to know?  well even the rice is different basmati rice has been developed for thousands of years to get the size of grain and taste:  they care about what grain of rice they use it has to be basmati (uncle joes brown rice just isnt the same sorry)  this is the feeling i get from tt2 they know what authentic indian food is and what it takes to make it and it is no trivial slap-a-burger-on-the-grill-and-fry-it type of food  it takes days of preparation to put out the correct recipe and it doesnt come from canned pastes    this really shows up in the end result at tandoori times 2 and makes their somewhat high priced menu worth it if you know what really goes into making good cuisine of india  finally someone is putting in the time and effort to making really good indian food tandoori times has a number of locations here in the valley and ive had the good fortune of eating at this one and the one located off of i-17 & cactusive eaten at this location at least 10 times as its one of my wifes favorite restaurants  we went on a thursday night and walked in with a groupon which they readily acceptedone of the positives is that they have a full bar and a very nice wine list which my wife appreciates  i like the full bar in case i want an old fashioned as im not much of a wine drinkeri ordered the lamb vindaloo and the princess ordered the chicken vindaloo  the dinner portions are really family style with enough food for a couple of people so needless to say we went home with leftovers  it sure didnt hurt my feelings to have to scarf that down for lunch the next day  the basmati rice is terrific a little saffron and other spices and its perfect with the vindaloo over the top of itthe meal comes with naan and i love naan  we buy it at costco just to have around the house  the naan here is a whole different level than what i pull out of that bag let me tell you!  soft light and perfectly toasted  we upgraded to the chili naan which has green chilies sprinkled all over it  its awesome definitely worth the next $1 or whatever it isfinished the meal with dessert (surprise surprise)  went with the rice pudding which is of a much lighter consistency that what i would say most americans are used to it was very good perfect way to end the meal and cleanse my palate which is my argument for always having dessert   it has the same flavor components as typical rice pudding cinnamon raisins a little nutmeg just not with the custard-like consistencethey seem to be gradually upgrading the restaurant with new paint and decorations; its a very comfortable restaurant with consistently good servicei think youll like it,4.5,2,5626 W Bell Rd Ste A-103 Glendale AZ 85308
Star of India,its been almost two years since i last visited star of india and my absence is due to other reasons and not bec of the food  some good eats ive tried here are the chicken tikka masala basmati rice and chicken naan the latter of which was overflowing with chunks of tender marinated chicken  add a side salad and youve a delicious meal i loved this place the minute i stepped in the door!  its fairly small beautiful inside & very comfortable & cozy  the lighting is just right & indian soft jazz & soft rock playing in the background were not offensivethere was no soup which would have been nice but after the standard indian salad i dug into chicken vindaloo malai kofta (vegetable dumplings in a sauce) alloo kobhi yellow dahl & more unusual treats along with the usual basmati rice good chicken tikka masala & so on  along the way my very friendly & attentive server brought me a plate of hand prepared tandoori chicken  that was a nice touch & it was moist & good!  almonds in the rice pudding for dessert made it extra good toothe great atmosphere food & service here make it one of my favorite indian lunch buffet places here in the valley!  its $999 this place is the spot for lunch! i mean come on its indian food buffet style! whats not to like about that they serve you garlic naan or plain naan also buffet (all you can eat) the have all the standard fare as well as basmati rice i always eat about a metric ton of food and when i get the bill thats right $10 starbucks costs more than that!! definitely try this place out,3.6666666666666665,3,4025 E Chandler Blvd Ste 14 Phoenix AZ 85048
Copper Kettle-Salads Balti & Taandoori Grill,the other night my girlfriends and i were starving after a book and author event that we attended at dobson high school  craving indian food we stopped into copper kettle which is located in the closest shopping center to the school  its not often that i feel invisible but the poor service we received here made me feel that way  there were only two other occupied tables when we walked in and the wait staff made me feel like i was intruding on something important  they were all standing around a table and i had to actually make eye contact to get the head nod directing us to our seats  after asking for water three times we finally got it with our entrees (not to mention that you cant order a kingfisher to wash your meal down because they dont sell alcoholic beverages)  yes they ignored all of our requests for something to drink until they could bring it with our food  the food was actually fine  we ordered three vegetarian dishes - the lentils vegetable curry and a cauliflower dish  the spice level was right but the portions were pretty small  and they charge for rice   thats one of my biggest pet peeves  has the price of basmati rice gone up so much that you have to make me feel silly for asking if its included?  i love indian/pakistani food but the poor service here was more memorable than my stomachs happiness so i dont think ill be returning if i find myself in the area again exotic warm spicey radiantly delicious everything i tasted got better and better says my wife we had the chicken tikka masala the matar paneer pea pulao (basmati rice) and a garlic & cilantro nan the portions were generous we havent had much indian (or pakistani) food before but just the past week we had some while visiting sedona and its very interesting to see the different styles of preparation  the masala at copper kettle was thicker and i dont think the sauce was spiced as much (as the place in sedona) the chicken in the masala on the other hand was spiced beautifully (fairly hot)  there was a buffet available (at dinner) but we opted for fresh preparation and although we waited a little bit for our food it was worth it the staff was very friendly and assisted us with our selection  we look forward to our next visit!,3.0,2,1050 E Lemon St Tempe AZ 85281
Maharaja Restaurant,went here for the first time while visiting a friend and i must say this place is pretty good im a fan of indian food by far and this place rocked the only gripe i had was that they had a batch of basmati rice on the buffet for a while and when i put it on the plate it was too crunchy i told them about it and thy immediately put out another pot of rice which was freshthe mango ice cream was out of this worldi like this place and would return,3.0,1,6713 Odana Rd Madison WI 53719
Saffron Flavors of India,really happy that they opened back up so i could finally try them my mother and i went for dinner on a friday night around 6 pm the establishment is divided into two areas there is a bar on one side and on the other side is the dining area there were a few tables occupied but not busy yet two very cheerful servers greeted us and after being seated asked if we had any questionseverything on the menu is ala cart so it can be pricey they brought us a basket of papadum and couple of chutneys the green chutney was my favorite while the red was a little too sour for my taste we started off with two mango lassis and paneer pakora my go-to drink at any indian restaurant is mango lassi i can usually down 2-4 of them during the course of a good meal these did not disappoint; nice and creamy with just the right amount of sweetness and perfectly smooth the paneer pakora was huge not really that used to appetizers at an indian restaurant being that big we were going to get full before the meal came the pakora was crispy and brown and we also spread the chutneys that came with the papadum on them the paneer has a bit of a nutty flavor and is sort of the consistency of very firm tofufor entrees we ordered butter chicken tandoori chicken and kadai ghosht the butter chicken was good i got it at spicy level 5 was not to enthused about moms tandoori chicken it came out all sizzling and hot on the plate but the piece i had was flavorful but dry mom said i must have picked the only dry piece on the plate since hers were pretty juicy i think my favorite dish was the kadai ghosht it is a lamb curry with onions garlic and ginger it was very tender and succulent and the flavor was out of this world we also had panner naan (good) and garlic naan (very garlicky so very good) as well as they served us a small dish of basmati rice to share between usnow as far as the service goes its the type of service i expected i dont think i have ever been to an indian restaurant were the servers are snappy they are not bad but if you are expecting to be in and out the you are out of luck they were very cheerful and quite helpful our server was a bit too eager to clear our plates away (even when we hadnt finished yet) i was a bit alarmed to hear a server recommend to a family a vindaloo when they asked what was a good dish that was not spicy but considering they go on a 1 to 10 spice level for every dish i suppose that was okay? after hiking at mount charleston four of us stopped here to try their lunch buffet  one of our group has been here before and recommended it  it was a good recommendation!the buffet is small but is in the size range of others  at $1199 its price is ok  not the cheapest not the most expensive  the restaurant is attractive with comfortable seating  there is a separate section through which you enter where the bar is located  the buffet is in an adjoining area out of view from the dining roomthere was a selection of salad yogurt chutney and desserts at the beginning of the buffet  after the initial bar there were several chafing dishes with various foods  i tried the chicken tikka masala a curry chicken dal makhani onion pakora and some fried chicken balls--the name of which i cant remember  accompanying this was basmati rice  for the most part the dishes were good and flavorful  the dal was bland  it could have used some seasoning  the chicken balls were tasty and different  i should have gotten some chutney for that and the onion pakora but i failed to do so  next time  one of our group noted that the chicken tandoori was dry  i didnt try this but noted this for future reference  i made a second trip to the buffet to get something sweet to offset my disposition  i got one gulab jamun and it was very good  it was quite soft and it was not overly sweet  a very nice ending to lunchservice was average  we were there when the restaurant opened and it soon got busy but there were a couple of people working the small room  when i went to get my gulab my dirty plate was not removed  other than this things went okif im in the area id certainly stop again  it is in the middle tier of indian buffets ive tried  since its the closest place to where i live ill be back  i wouldnt recommend coming from the other side of town for the buffet when there are other places just as good or better in the unlv area,3.5,2,4450 N Tenaya Way Ste 115 Northwest Las Vegas NV 89129
Taj Palace,we are so thrilled to have excellent indian food so close to home! i cant believe we didnt try it sooner  we loved the menu with all the many items not found in every indian restaurant  i love hot spicy vindaloo sauce which was cooked to perfection in their lamb vindaloo  my husband had the lamb madras not quite so hot also cooked to perfection  the accompaniments of basmati rice and naan bread along with delicious mango chutney and cool refreshing cucumber raita more than our expectations  the service was great and the ambiance as well  the best part was we had leftovers for lunch the next day! next we will try their lunch buffet we will highly recommend it to all lovers of indian cuisine as well as novices who want to try something to really treat their palate especially lovers of spicy hot food like myself their offer of dine-in and carry-out as well as catering makes it complete! this recently opened indian restaurant was not very busy on the monday evening of our visit  we recived complimentary papadum with a spicy mint sauce and the worst tamarind sauce i have ever encountered  our entrees were boti kabob masala (lamb chunks in a rich yellow curry) and murgh madras (boneless chicken in a tomato/cream curry)  in addition we ordered naan and zeera rice (lightly spiced basmati rice with cumin seeds)  neither entr√©e scaled any culinary heights though the amount of animal protein in each would likely have caused hannibal lechter to rejoice i felt menu prices separate charge for plain rice were on the high side as far as indian food goes taj palace is delicious as far as service? our waiter vimal treated us like queens its the typical strip-mall exterior like almost all restaurants in henderson nv coming from los angeles im starting to get used to great restaurants like this - after all many wonderful treasures can be found in strip-mall style buildings in lawhen we were seated around 8:30 pm the entire restaurant was empty so there was no wait vimal brought out papadum (indian bread crispy and very thin like a cracker) with hot green sauce and a tasty plum sauce we ordered veggie samosas to start which seemed to be hand-made at the restaurant and were spectacular vimal convinced us to try nasi biryani rice instead of the traditional white basmati rice i normally order its like an indian fried rice with golden raisins and almonds that has a yellow coloring from the spices delicious that came out with our chicken tikka masala in medium spiciness and our garlic naan every dish was better than the last at this point a middle-aged couple came into the nicely decorated restaurant and sat down to dinner as well i think its surprising that the place was so empty considering how yummy everything was the other couple verbally recognized this and asked vimal about it as well it seems new ownership took over more than a year ago and he just needs to get the word out so heres the word - well be stopping by again soon to check out the buffet for lunch that seems like a great value! i had high hopes for my meal at taj palace  i read the series of yelp reviews and even recall a few friends stating it was a good place for curry i have to presume it was a bad night for the team at taj palace as much as it pains me to write a negative review i have to be true to my experience we arrived on friday evening around 8:30 pm the yelp reviews for taj were higher than ping kao 3 my intended destination  upon arrival i noticed the large dining room had a total of three occupied tables  the friendly waiters greeted and seated our party of two promptly to make a long story bearable i will cut to the chase i ordered a medium butter chicken at $1700 i anticipated a fantastic dish my partner ordered a $1600 lamb dish he will write his own review  to our amazement the two dishes did not come with naan or rice we ordered these items on the side the plain basmati rice was $500 and the naan was $350  the food came out within ten minutes have to give an a for speed and service during the pre-dinner service this team was on top of it there were four servers for our table our water was never empty and the empty or unused plates/utensils disappeared quickly so on to the food i will only speak to my own dish i have had several butter chicken (murgh makhani) dishes at different places i am familiar with the expected flavor this particular dish just did not taste like any butter chicken; i have had in the past the color of the dish looked proper but the flavor was off it almost tasted as if they used mayonnaise instead of cream or yogurt in the dish it was slimy and did not have a good flavor at all to supplement the flavor the meat within the dish was chopped into small bits there were also chunks of bone fat and bay leaf it was just awful some might say you should have sent it back i have warded off sending any dishes back at restaurants there are too many horror stories  i simply did not finish it the post-dinner service left us sitting with dirty dishes for twenty minutes when the two waiters finally collected the plates they did not ask about our experience and did not notice most of my butter chicken was still in the dish  i do not expect anyone to read my mind it had to be a bad night  maybe i will try again in the future it is a well decorated charming indian restaurant in the middle of a strip mall on eastern parking can be a hassle on the weekends for dinner due to it being located next to overly popular and equally overrated bjsthe service is always incredible the servers are friendly accommodating and extremely willing to make suggestions to get you out of the chicken tikka masala comfort zone for dinner boyfriend had spicy vindalo ($15) which is chicken cooked with potatoes spices and vindaloo sauce which is the red variety of sauce it was not very spicy as i believe they modified it due to fear of us not being able to handle the heat i love my food spicy the dish was good neverthelessi had the spicy haryali ($16) which was chicken cooked in spicy green sauce made with onion spinach mint cilantro and green chili once again it was very delicious but not spicy we ordered side of gralic naan ($350) and it was very goodalso the server suggested we get peas pilau ($7) which was basmati rice seasoned with peas nuts and raisins i didnt care for the raisins and probably would opt for just regular basmati rice next time we also shared an indian variety of beer based on the servers suggestion it was good and quite large ($8)all in all the food was good and the portions generousbut the total did leave a bit of a sticker shock i think id opt for the lunch buffet and try to sample more of their dishes  the service as i mentioned before was superb  i would recommend this place if you are in the area and craving quality indian food and great service ---rant---great stuff~ the rice dishes were as spicy hot as id hoped they were and the tandoori shrimp were more like tandoori prawns (real sized prawns) portions were huge!  thats always awesome! service was great; just what i expected answered questions brought us more water on a regular basis check came quickly food came quickly etcthis place is way better than mount everest indias cuisine!  i dont know understand why that place gets more stars than taj palace; this place has better portions comparable prices and better service  and the food comes out faster!!!after my first visit here i came back the very next night for takeout; more tandoori shrimp basmati rice and the usual chicken masala  cant go wrongif you want great indian food at reasonable prices and you have a big stomach definitely visit taj palace!~criticisms:- lighting could have been better seemed kind of dingy- decor could use an upgrade---overall---service: a  servers were friendly and answered questions i had about the foodfood: a+ great selection big portionsatmosphere: b- chill and relaxed but could use an upgrade in lighting and decor been here about a couple times now and i must say i like the placeservice has been pretty good the staff are friendly and attentivethe food takes longer to make and prep in my opinion but worth the wait as soon as you get to eating!what ive gotten the last two visits are the infamous tikka masala and chicken tandooritikka masala - famous dish in all indian places that they guarantee all first timers will like pieces of moist tender chicken cooked in a tomato-y gingery sauce! very rich and hearty! suggest you dip their freshly baked garlic naan in this sauce!chicken tandoori - sizzling marinated chicken cooked in the tandoor on a bed of peppers and onions seasoned very well comes out in the red color because of the spices moist and a little spicy for my palette but i still love the dish! great to eat with their basmati rice!im glad we took our friend sandra r here for her first time a bit scared at first because she hated the smell that all indian places have she liked it definitely ate everything on her plate upon paying and getting ready to leave the waiter was so sweet providing a small bowl of mango ice cream and put a candle on it because it was her birthday small gestures are a plus!will definitely be coming back when craving indian food!i hope to try their buffet style one day but available only from monday - sunday11:00am to 3:00pm,4.0,7,9530 S Eastern Ave Ste 180 Southeast Henderson NV 89123
Kalpna Restaurant,having just finished exams i visited kalpna for the third time last night with my boyfriend to celebrate whilst i can understand the criticisms of others regarding the compulsory service charge of 10% if you mentally calculate it while ordering your meal it doesnt actually make this an expensive meal sure-it would be better if they let you decide how much of a tip you want to give regardless aside from this i cannot praise the food anymore than i already have i went for a memorable masala dosa again and it didnt disappoint it was crispy the filling was spicy and full of flavour and the sauces absolutely delicious i was offered a refill of the sambar when i eagerly ate it before touching the dosa the peanut and chilli dip was really quite special the coconut cooling and creamy as it should be there were so many exciting flavours going on! robbies thali was equally exciting: he got a few fried starters like pakoras with two dips 2 fresh-from-the-oven naan two mini portions of curry: one aubergine the other okra a lentil dhal steamed basmati rice and a cardamom and pistachio rice pudding it was beautifully served on a traditional silver thali plate garnished with salad it looked doable but he soon found himself struggling with a huge quantity of food fortunately it was so good that he did find that extra room in his stomach for everything for pudding i opted for a saffron kulfi it was creamy extremely delicious and dense unlike european ice cream with it softer and airier the taste of saffron was very present the dosa cost ¬£875 the thali ¬£1250 and the kulfi ¬£350 having tried just about every south indian in town i must emphasise that this is the most authentic dosas are naturally vegetarian and the addition of chicken and other meat is a western variation on a par with woodlands in london,5.0,1,2-3 St Patrick Square Newington Edinburgh EH8 9EZ
Udupi Indian Veg & Vegan Cuisine,before i go into details about todays experience at udupi i want to attest that the food i had tasted wonderful  my friend and i agreed to meet for lunch  i was the first to arrive by at least ten minutes  this gave me ample time to survey the buffet and ask the host questions concerning my food allergies  however before i started with the allergy questions i inquired if the buffet came with dosa  the host said yes  (we would later find out during check out that buffet dosa cost an additional $4  so the correct answer would be no)  after all of my questions had been answered i concluded that only the white basmati rice bread (plain paratha and iddly) four of six chutneys homemade papadum and dessert [homemade cottage cheese balls (think non-fried gulab jamun) soaked in sweetened coconut milk sprinkled with crushed pistachios and other spices] were allergen-free  im not much of a chips and dips person (unless spinach artichoke garlic and cheese and a few whole wheat crostini are involved) so my prospects concerning the buffet looked pretty grim  while attempting to place a phone call and i wondering out loud if i should have my friend meet me elsewhere i spied a dish containing one dosa sitting on my table  the host overheard my asking my friend if he was going to have the buffet (yes that was his intention) and i then asked the host that rather i have my friend meet me elsewhere which meant that the dosa would have to be thrown away could he have the buffet and dosa and i could order something off the menu?  yes was the answer  before i even looked at the menu i ordered the palak paneer with rice  he quickly turned in my order and i proceeded to take a couple of bites of the now-cooled dosa  the host suddenly did a 180 and returned to my table to tell me that i couldnt share my friends buffet or else he would have to charge me for another buffet  i said that i was only having the cold dosa which he would have to throw away had i decided to leave and he said that it was against restaurant policy for two people to share the buffet  i said i understood that i wasnt intending to share my friends buffet entree but that i was only having the cold dosa which my friend would probably prefer to be hot and fresh  (i made a mental note not to come back here anymore or at least not to come back anytime soon  i also thought i should have gone with the idea of going somewhere else)friend finally arrived grabbed some buffet items and sat down to eat  it took about 20 minutes for my palak paneer (spinach homemade cottage cheese cubes onions spices and coconut curry) entree to arrive but the wait was definitely worth it- the spinach leaves had a beautiful dark green color to it and werent at all mushy the cubes of cheese were meaty on the outside and creamy on the inside and the onions cubed chilies and spinach stems and other spices perfected the masterpiece  i can eat this over rice or stuff it into dosa or pita bread and be blissful!its good to know that the food served here is delectable  it must be said however that other than the news that the venue has been under new management for over a year now i would not have been able to surmise anything had changed at all- invariant furniture and decor; consistent and scrumptious food (same cooks in place?); and familiar faces among the staff (even the same hosts manning the door and register)  i wish the new management sustained success decent selection of vegetarian indian fare but the price per head is a bit staggering ($1699) it isnt terrible especially if youre a vegetarian (or vegan as they have some vegan dishes) and want to comfortably be able to eat without worrying about meat the selection isnt expansive and the place isnt necessarily upscale but the service is good its good to try at least once especially if you love indian food and want to try a different side of it free of goat or chickenfood-wise youve got your typical variations of dals and lentils in different cream sauces your basmati rice and your dessert table of milk cake and rice pudding im sorry there isnt much of anything else to say some other places id recommend over udupi for typical delicious and cheaper indian food would have to be jewel of the crown in old town scottsdale and delhi palace on asu campus my  first experience of udupi was the lunch buffet  being an avid carnivore i was very impressed with the vegetarian and vegan dishes provided here  this being southern indian cuisine the options were uniquely different from the indian fare i am used to and i was especially thrilled about the prevalence of coconut in the dishesthe culinary journey through southern india began with a vada a  donut-like fritter made with lentils  dipped in the spicy tomato chutney or coconut chutney it was delectable!next came the rajma aloo a flavorful potato dish with beansthe daal curry made of lentils peas and beans and flavored with cumin and other indian spices was outstanding with the basmati ricethe highlight  was definitely the shai paneer with a coconut cream sauce  the paneer so traditional to southern indian cuisine has a texture and taste like that of tofu  the difference is that it is cheese made by curdling heated milk with lemon juice and vinegareven the kheer rice pudding cooked with milk and honey garnished with raisins and almonds was heavenlywith an endless supply of dosai thin crepe-like bread that you can use for scooping your food or rolling your dishes into it was a excellent lunch buffet for roughly $10/personi will definitely be coming back here for dinner and introducing my vegetarian friends to this delightful establishment,3.3333333333333335,3,1636 N Scottsdale Rd Tempe AZ 85281
Delhi Palace Cuisine of India,ive eaten at delhi palace many times always hoping it would be better  the buffet does offer many choices and its a great stop for lunch if your standards for indian food are fairly low  i eat indian food quite often at a variety of restaurants so i have high standards  the prices here for entres are about average (just under $10) for indian  the rice and naan must be ordered separately which is also not uncommon  the service certainly was prompt and that is appreciated  in fact it seemed like we had two waiters last night as two gentleman brought us food refilled our drinks and checked in on us  the disappointment came from the quality of food  it did not taste fresh  the basmati rice was somewhat hard which may mean it was overcooked or old  the malai kofta that i ordered usually a fool-proof dish also tasted chewy and somewhat old  one of my companions was very happy with her chicken curry  the other companion was very disappointed with the yoghurt masala which she said was devoid of any solid food and was much too spicy for mild as requested  if youre near asu i suppose it will have to do but there are many tastier options in the same plaza/strip mall  i would not come back if i could avoid it good tandoori chicken  skip the bland lamb curry  spinach curry was delicious; eat it with basmati rice  excellent samosas  heavenly gulab jamun  the carrot squares were delicious as well  wash it all down with chai  $9 lunch buffet  cant wait to try again! i was very impressed with this place  having a serious craving for indian (after reading its review) i could think of nothing else  i drove from mid-scottsdale to try this location out and i am glad i did  it was absolutely delicious  i did find that the selection was a bit small for the lunch buffet but with the never-ending naan and basmati rice and the indian tea i was blown away  this place was my perfect fix for indian  i am planning on making this a usual haunt for lunch and dinner  also the price was very reasonable  $12 for all you can indian was more than i could have asked for especially given the prices at other restaurants  thank you so much yelp for suggesting i go eat indian today i have visited this restaurant several times i went with my co-workers about three times and with friends about two times each time i visited i was seated immediatelyi have only ever went during the buffet lunch time i highly recommend the basmati rice the tandoori chicken and the spinach dish i absolutely loved the naan flatbread that they give you which is similar to indian fry bread the naan comes out hot and soft the tea is not sweet but there is sugar on the tableoverall this is an amazing place that i would go to again and again1-never again2-try once more3-average4-liked5-will come back again after seeing countless movies that depicted indian food as extremely spicy i was very hesitant and scared to try indian food for my first time my sister insisted that i come along with her to this indian restaurant- delhi palace for their lunch buffet i picked her up from work and off we went i went through the line of the buffet carefully picking my meal i managed to grab myself some lamb curry basmati rice and salad i came back to my table and the waiter served us our drinks as well as some delicious naan delhi palace toasts the naan as well as adds a garlic kick the naan arrives to your table steamy hot!i finally dug in too my food and was so pleasantly surprised after feeling like i could take on any type of indian food i went back to the buffet for seconds and tried more dishes all of the dishes exceeded my expectations i definitely recommend going to the lunch buffet it is well worth the money! more bang for your buck! the restaurant is also very conveniently located next to the asu-tempe campus so if youre a student and youre looking for some delicious indian food during a class break you should check out this hidden gem! oh weeee my friend and i ordered and shared the chicken spicy masala and a mild lamb vindaloo our good came in a timely manner and the restaurant was barely packed that didnt mean the food wasnt good! it was delicious we were served a really good appetizer that i cant recall the name but it was made of mint and/or cilantro it was free and it was oh soooo yummy after a couple of minutes we received our order with garlic naan and basmati rice i preferred the masala over the vindaloo but thats probably because it may have been more fatty and buttery i would come again thank you! for a good experience of indian food in tempe yumm this place is the best my wife and i always get the same taandori chicken garlic knaan basmati rice and mango juice and a mango lasi its cheap too plus udent discount,3.857142857142857,7,933 E University Dr Ste 103 Tempe AZ 85281
Indian Paradise,weve passed by indian paradise on many occasions going to costco and decided to check it out after an indian friend told us that they dine there  when we went in we saw quite a few tables of indians eating which was very reassuringwe went for the $899 lunch buffet and found the food to be good not amazing  the naan seemed like it was baked in a regular oven - not puffy like when it comes out of the tandoori oven such as the ones at tandoori times  all the chicken was tender except for the chicken in the masala which was a bit dry - im guessing that they used the previous days buffets tandoori chicken  the veg dishes were all flavorful except for the lentil soup which was quite blandbuffet offerings consisted of:- pappadum (thin crispy spiced wafer with spices)- channa masala (chick peas in a spiced gravy)- dal makhani (lentils in tomato butter sauce)- navratan korma (assorted veg in a creamy sauce)- saag (spinach cooked in spices)- chicken curry- chicken masala (tandoori chicken in tomato butter sauce)- tandoori chicken- lentil soup / tomato soup - assorted pickles and chutneys- basmati rice- fresh-baked naan is brought to your table- rice pudding is the sole dessertid come back to try their extensive offering of lamb dishes on the dinner menu especially given what an ethnic wasteland north scottsdale is  the prices on the online menu seem a bit dated - dishes are in general $1 more the wifey and i are still on our indian kick  very clean and inviting inside we were there about 6pm on friday night and there were 2 or 3 other couples therewe started with the chefs assorted appetizer which was 2 samosa vegetable pakora (sliced potato breaded and fried) and chicken pakora (spiced chicken chunks) and onion bhaji (shredded onion fritter)  the samosa had great flavor the chicken pakora was great and the onion bhaji was very goodfor our meal we always seem to get way too much food but were not afraid of having leftoversfish vindaloo (swordfish): fish chunks were perfectly cooked and flaked apart good white meat didnt find one chunk of the fishy-grey part vindaloo sauce was pretty decent but sort of seemed to be one note to me  not bad at all just not greatpaneer tikka masala: great paneer very smooth and not gritty at all  the masala was excellent imo with great flavorvegetable biryani: pretty good biryani but not a huge portion not sure how much raisins or nuts were in it  again not bad but not omg this is the bombnaan: we had the plain naan which was just as expectedbasmati rice: the meal comes with plain basmati rice as wellspice level: we ordered medium plus but it was fairly mild  the masala was slightly spicier than the vindaloo (my understanding is that vindaloo is supposed to be spicier by default)  we mentioned to the waiter that it wasnt spicy enough and he offered to bring out some hot sauce which was a small bowl of vindaloo with extra spice in it  this was perfect and my wife mixed it in with her mealservice: 4 stars  attentive waiters great service (however there was not customers at the time)  food came quicklyappearance: clean well litfood: 3 stars  the food was fine i liked the masala the best  we will definitely go back we have been looking for a good indian buffet and found it the place is a hidden treasure the food was delicious and buffet had a good variety good service great food and pretty good price chicken curry was my favorite and the basmati rice was delicious my love affair with indian cuisine started about 20 years ago when in medical school with friends from india both north and south india i learned the difference and also saw that the 20 somethings male and female knew how to cook a whole meal with the spices they brought from india in the little metal caddie with individual spice cups they even brought the basmati rice from home with a rice cooker! i fell in love with the food and the guy ( but thats an other story) although this place was not great before it was as close as were going to get to indian food in scottsdale ive been going for the last couple of years and today i went back after a few months absence and it was just not the same the taste the spices ( not the hotness ) was not the same at all! i have a feeling they changed owners as even the service was bad other friends have also commented that the food quality is bad now and i for one will not be going back  the rice was dry and taste severely missing even the cardamom pods were missing i had the curry and my companion the tikka masala and the tikka just tasted like tomato paste and the curry was tasteless   very disappointing !! i soo wished this could last the 3 stars is for my previous experienceanyone know if the owners are the same or have they sold the place and moved back to the mother land?? had the lunch buffet & the food was decent  for $1095 they have a variety of veg & non-veg dishes along with the  bread (naan) & basmati rice 2 soups - i tried the tomato soup & it was bad the paneer dishes(tikka masala & palak) were good the chicken curry was watery & of mediocre tastethe tandoori chicken was good howeverthe dal makhani & basmati rice were too bland & the desserts(gulab jamun & rice pudding) were just okayfinal verdict: the quality of the lunch buffet aint that great i know a lot of other indian restaurants that offer better food than this one they sure lack the quality on my scale you can give this one a try thoughps: i to-god kadai paneer once (√† la carte) & i loved it very delicious! tried the buffet for the same reason but was disappointed! oh what sadness the day that this restaurant decided to move their business to the north scottsdale branchwe always used to order indian food from indian paradise chandler because they made delicious naan basmati rice and all things indian curry for what its worth - go check out the scottsdale branch if you are in the areai have yet to go but i promised myself that i will put in a good word for this restaurant once i open my yelp accountliving in chandler i know that i will be going to the scottsdale branch as soon as i have reason to go in that direction,3.6666666666666665,6,2051 West Warner Rd Ste 7 Chandler AZ 85224
The Dhaba,this is my favorite indian restaurant in the valley  their curries are very flavorful and spicy  i usually get their vindaloo although ive had the dhaba curry and a couple others (both lamb and chicken)the naan is great and weve been given a couple desserts on the house that were fun and interesting  they do a good job of trying to find some stuff for our kids to eat but we usually just bring something along for them to have with basmati ricemy wife gets their chiken tikka masala and she loves itwe often go here for lunch which is not a buffet (which we prefer) this was another groupon find of mine although i had heard about it (in a not so good light) from a friend however i do love me some indian food so i grabbed my partner and headed over therethe groupon was for $40 and at most places if get get apps food dessert and iced tea we hit that mark not here we each order the fanciest thali they had (comes with salad naan biranyi rice desser chai mini mango lassis dal and two veggie dishes) but they were only $15 a piece so we wound up ordering two more starters (the potato pancake chaat and fried paneer) in order to hit our price point and then we took a lot of food homethe mango lassis were delicious as was the salad  i wasnt such a fan of the chaat - it was a little too spicy and a little too mushy i loved the fried paneer but who doesnt love fried cheese? it was great with the tamarind chutneyas far as the main meal i loved everything (though next time will go with plain basmati rice) i especially enjoyed the paneer tikka masala and the malai kofta my favorite dish ever the dal was good -- ive never seen kidney beans in it before but i liked it the only thing i didnt absolutely love was the saag paneer - the texture was too smooth however my partner scarfed it downfor dessert i was expecting rice pudding or the sweet balls instead our awesome server asked if wed tried carrot fudge we hadnt so she brought that outi liked it except for the sultana raisins (i hate raisins) it didnt hit the spot for my partner though and the chai wasnt as strongly spiced as i like (plus i prefer honey to sugar packets as far as sweetening it)well be back for sure i might go with a small thali but its a really good deal and an excellent amount of good food for the value glad i found it! i had bought a restaurantcom gift cert for this place so we decided to try it out friday night its a small eatery in an indian plaza once seated i immediately noticed the pewter-style dish and water cup on the table not the norm so it was a nice unique touch we ordered a vegetarian-style appetizer platter with fried cheese potato-filled dumplings and other veggie delights it was amazing! my man ordered the vegetable-dumpling stew and i ordered the kidney beans we got an order of basmati rice and garlic naan to go with it with all of this and the crispy thing you get in the beginning (im not sure what its called) we were stuffed and had leftovers for lunch the next day our water glasses were repeatedly refilled which is always a plus for me  the menu is huge but broken down into veggie options chicken lamb etc ive been to other indian restaurants where the food was equally good but i enjoy the different touches such as the dinnerware not to mention the attentive service  well be back! the dhaba was a real treat!  i went on a weekday evening about 8:30pm and was surprised how busy it was  first good sign the two of us were immediately seated and served chilled water in the most interesting copper goblets  a selction of chutney and papadum came right away as well  the hostess was also our server she took our beverage order while we began a strategy of what to order  the menu was very extensive and contained many items i had never heard of before despite the wide array of choices we stayed pretty basic choosing a paneer masala chicken tikka a savory chick pea dish and of course basmati rice and naan  the meal came quickly and was the freshest i think i have ever had  every bite was phenomenalfrom the service to the dishes and everything in between made this experience truly memorable  i cannot wait to go back!!the only thing i would change- now i am being hyper critical would be the lighting  it was very bright for an evening meal  i guess it made me appreciate the appearance of the food easier i think maybe the bf and i are cursed i believe that this restaurant is awesome but we just came at the wrong day and time we went here tonight with a deal chicken deal that was like 44$ for 92$ worth of food that included: four beers/glasses of wine two apps two mains two sides two desserts and two chai teas well the place was overrun by a table of about 20 so the service was slow and they ran out of chai only having enough to give us like half of one glass also they only brought us each one drink so i felt like that was kind of lame especially considering we had to pay tax and 18% tip on 92$ worth of food when we really got maybe 65$ worth of food pretty lame other than that the place was good we got the fried paneer which i actually wasnt a huge fan of kind of bland but then ive never had paneer so that may just be what it tastes like the app with the fluffy bread and chickpea curry was really good the bread was almost like a savory donut or something yum for mains we got chicken tikka masala and  lamb korma i usually love the ctm but i think the pieces of chicken were too big which made them kind of dry and not as flavorful as it could be the lamb korma however was wonderful! the meat was super tender and the curry was great they also had good basmati rice and garlic naan for dessert i got their ice cream which is more ice -y than creamy almost like frozen rice or something but it was very good the bf got the rice pudding and enjoyed it we also enjoyed the chai (what we got of it anyway) so i would probably return and eat way less food but maybe ill be more picky when it comes to using deals at this place as it didnt really turn out to be a deal at all we did not make the trek to the east side with the dhaba on our minds but as we drove past it to our intended destination i said look honey thats dhaba it gets great reviews and has been written up in phoenix magazine  the main man replied its indian right? we like indian that naan bread mmmmmmso we did what we went east to do and decided we had to give the dhaba a go  there was no wait even though we had no reservation  the hostess/waitress/manager was an absolutely gorgeous young woman who was very much into our learning experience and helped us sound out and pronounce our orders lamb dishes for both of uswe were given water and tea in a more than timely manner and the slight wait for our hand-made fresh food was well worth it!  mm got the basmati rice and i opted reluctantly as i steer clear of most carbs unless they are chocolate cake or cookies for the brown rice  both were fabulous with the moist tender lamb  both dishes of lamb were spicy without burning and the flavor was finally noticeable most indian food in the valley honestly lacks heat kick and flavor these dishes delivered in all three  what i did not notice until it was time for the go box is that the brown rice has the most elegant aromatic scent  i may not actually eat it but i will go to the fridge a million times just to smell it! all in all we were lucky to grab up a table with no reservation the food was awesome the service pleasantly solid  we are just sad the dhaba is way across town after getting my cars oil changed at hon-man i was feeling a bit peckish and decided to indulge in some tasty indian cuisine since the dhaba was a hop skip and a jump away i wanted an order to-go and inquired about getting a lunch special (no buffet but they do have some great looking daily lunch specials) unfortunately they will only give you the lunch deals if you eat in so i browsed through the extensive regular menu the prices seemed a little high compared to other indian restaurants in tempe i decided on the dhaba signature saag (spinach) dish ($12) there is a cute little waiting area where you can wait for your food to be made service was exceptional especially since it was to-go! the friendly hostess at the counter offered me some water while i waited and even offered to refresh the cup with more water for my trip back home the order came in a nice little brown shopping bag with handles the kind you would find at higher-end restaurantswhen i opened up the bag i had a really large portion of saag and basmati rice the saag had a nice balance of flavors and textures i could taste fresh ginger some creaminess and the delicate flavor of the spinach i had asked for it medium spicy and it was about right- not too spicy not too mild the basmati rice was cooked well had some vibrantly colored grains and was fragrant from the addition of spices such as cardamom and cuminoverall it was a pleasant meal and i have more than enough leftovers for a few more meals id love to dine in another time to try out more dishes and their lunch! very good indian food this is first place i experienced indian  and i have been hooked ever since this is my go to spot for chicken tikka masalaits super flavorful and is always good  i do wish they gave more chicken in the dish  but its a good because i usually use the remaining curry for my basmati ricemmmm  the service is fast! i call in my orders and i never have to wait which is a plus my addiction  for indian curry is quite abnormallol but nonetheless  i can always count on getting a great meal here came here for a valentines dinner with the hubby small space but the foods flavor makes up for it immensely we ordered the kolkata pani puri for starters little hollowed out puffed pastries stuffed with potatoes and chick peas which you pour tamarind flavored water on although the flavors were there they didnt work well together for the main course we got the dhaba chicken curry with aromatic basmati rice and some garlic naan this dish was delicious the chicken was boneless and tender the curry was rich with spices and heat the garlic naan was fresh and pillowy and worked great with the curry the serving size was perfect for two to share and we even had enough to take home!great atmosphere they even had a guy playing a sitar in the front of the restaurant! this restaurant is located in the india plaza next to a indian grocery store parking seems really scarce though and make sure you make a reservation they get booked! we went on a weekday afternoon at around 1230pm it was fairly emptythe food was a-mazing we had different tikka masalas with basmati rice perfect rendering i tried the gluten-free vegan roti and it was yummy especially with the plum sauce we got with the gulshan e bazar which were also gluten-free vegan and delicious as someone who cant eat gluten or eggs (and shouldnt eat dairy either really) i was amazed that i could have a satisfying allergen-free meal that was super delicious and the service was very friendly and very very helpful its a huge plus that their menus are marked for gf veg vegan (though dairy and eggs separated would be nice)! this is our 1st time dinning at the dhaba we loved the ambiance and the decor of the place the server/hostess was very nice and the food was amazing! we had the garlic naan lamb soup chicken mango curry chicken and lamb curry the basmati rice and garlic naan were out if this world the meats were all tender and tasty we also had chai tea and rice pudding and they were pretty good! the only down side is that the service was a little slow but we will definitely come back the portions are very good and filling! :),4.363636363636363,11,1872 E Apache Blvd Tempe AZ 85281
