Bawarchi Indian Cuisine,may be a bad day to get chicken tikka kebabchicken kebabs looked like they have been sleeping for days in the freezer and then got a chance to get into the plate what they call kebabheard the biriyani is good there but i think i am not in a mood to try my luck again the tikka masala and makhani are kind of runny compared to tandoori timesnot as thickbut the owner is kind good customer servicemy fav is the mango lassechicken tikka masala and chicken makhani are my favsi always call in my orders beforehandconvinient to go placebut always remember to check our food before you take it home! my friends have taken me to good biryani places so for some reason i dont think this was the best biryani but i dont know if what ive had was dum biryani or not  tried the chicken one and it didnt have the flavor i though maybe all those times it wasnt truly authentic or from a dif region?  they give you a lot of rice though  not a whole lot if chicken but youll find this under all the rice had the chicken tikka masala too and liked the flavor of the sauce ordered two mango lassis the first one came out about 5 minutes after we got our food (not before) the second one came out about 5 minutes after that one  the guy told me the lady was making them in the back  it was a bit strange on the timing but tells me that there was literally one person in the back doing the main cooking  cleanliness: i am by no means a germ-a-phobe and rarely bothered by how a place looks but there was something about this place that didnt sit right with me  not sure what but i noticed it i thought the reviews were over reacting but for once there is some legitimacy thankfully i just let it pass  i will warn you though that the owner or guy at the counter is not so willing to give up his to-go containers i asked for a second container to replace the sauce container we had bc it had gotten really dirty the guy started pointing to the container and muttered something before finally giving it to me funny despite all this i will be back  there are some things on the menu that seemed more local to the region that i dont see at other places so would be great to try them its more like a 35pros: good chicken tikka masala pretty good naan yummy samosas spicy but not too spicy very reasonably priced and good for takeout friendly servicecons: the dal curry had a strange consistency echoing some of the earlier comments the restaurant isnt that clean also not a germaphobe and have lower expectations for hole-in-the-wall/mom and pop shops but still seemed like it wasnt clean enough great takeout love the chicken tikka marsala  were fans! i got the chicken tikka masala and the garlic naan bread everything was all right nothing super fancy the chicken had clumps of some spice that i couldnt tell you what it was however i wasnt pleased with that as it was an overpower explosion of spice in a few bites that i discovered those the naan bread was rather rubbery and the garlic tasted sweet to be honest with you though it did taste really good and for the price that i paid i would definitely return if you are looking to dine in with some elegance this is not the place  if you want to feast on possibly the best indian food in the valley you have found the place!  channa masala was delicious garlic naan is fantastic and the chicken tikka masala is great too!  you cannot go wrong with this place but be prepared for a plan b as this place will sometimes randomly be closed  try to call ahead if you can finally a great place for curry near me right off the 51! have gone here several times and always impressed i cant waiver from the chicken tikka masala and garlic naan but thank god my gf gets the palak paneer so i can get another awesome flavor change i am yet to see another white person in there when i go so you know its authentic but very clean and professional small inside so we normally get it to go and there has never been a mistake made,3.625,8
Royal Taj,i was totally jonesing for indian food and since none of my friends like indian food i decided to go solo  thats always an awkward thing but i was undeterred in my quest!ive been to royal taj many times and it is consistently good  the naan is fabulous the chicken tikka masala is always tender and delicious and the palak paneer is incredibleits not one of those places to go if youre looking for outstanding service or ambience but the food is always great! im indian and have eaten at several of the indian restaurants in the valley yes i recognize that indian restaurants in phoenix generally suck  so with that in mind royal taj is the second best indian restaurant in the valley (guru palace is #1) in another city with quality indian restaurants this restaurant would get 35 to 4 starts but for phoenix its the best  its a true indian punjabi restaurant that makes great malai kofta chicken tikka masala palak paneer boti kebob and tandoori chicken  they serve their tandoori dishes on sizzling clay plates which even nice restaurants like dehli palace (tempe: university and rural) doesnt dothat being said the restaurant isnt without its flaws its located in an abandoned strip mall that can feel unsafe at times with strange people walking around  in addition the restaurant had a bad odor the other night  the service needs improvement  there is essentially one server for the entire restaurant (the wife of the cook) she is very sweet but doesnt speak english well but she understands english perfectly  the lamb is a little dry  i would stick to their curries with all of this being said it is the second best indian restaurant in the valley  a lot of the so-called indian restaurants like tandoori times are really pakastani restaurants which is a different style of cuisine that specializes in more grilled items but uses less spices and sauces its also not a south indian restaurant posing as a north indian restaurant good-quality food and very consistent  my group enjoyed the chicken tikka masala lamb karahi mutter paneer (peas and homemade cheese in a coconut curry sauce) with basmati rice and aloo paratha (naan with potatoes and peas)  their vegetable samosas are pretty tasty too!service could be much better  we had to wait awhile to order the food dessert and then again for the ticket  btw portions are pretty slim but the flavors all but make up for the small portions this place is proof that phoenicians are more about style than substance like another poster mentioned the place is empty and it shouldnt be because the food is delicious yes its a hole in the wall but its also safe: think broadway and the 101we are not talking maryvale herethe food is wonderful the chicken tikka masala isnt a cheap gravy soup there are actual pieces of boneless white chicken breast the sauce has a perfect red-orange color with a nice creamy consistency and unlike 90% of phoenix indian restaurants they didnt overdo the tomato in this curry so its not sour and has a nice buttery and smooth flavor the saag paneer is thick and uses real spinach; its not a campbells cream of spinach soup with some mirchi and the malai kofta is arguably the best in the city the kofta balls are not hard and doughy and the sauce has a nice creamy texture its a difficult dish to do and if you want to see if an indian restaurant is legitimate order the malai kofta if a place butchers that dish leave because if they cant do that dish well you know its not a real indian restaurantthis place is a true mom and pop joint no this is the real thing meaning the pop cooks and the mom waits tables literally i love that but if you are joe phoenix and are expecting to eat at a scottsdaled up pf changs version of an indian restaurant go to dhaba up the street if you actually want good food go herethe service is friendly but the problem is the mom is the only server suprisingly she is faster than 3 or 4 teenage servers at most phoenix restaurants but still i have to be objective and find something wrong rightso there you go slow servicenonetheless this place is charming because its anti phoenix its a family owned restaurant the ambience is sincere you genuinely get the idea that you are dining to a home cooked meal yes the place could do more in regards to the ambience it really reminds you of an 80s restaurant but i could care less about that other stuff im about the food and service i always get treated like im the owners kids and she treats everyone like that and the food is wonderful what more could you ask for? this nice mid-sized place has patio dining available during the cooler months and a full bar  its comfortable inside & the food is ok but to me there was nothing exciting about the place  the chicken tikka masala was delicious but the lentil soup & yogurt salad dressing were not as good as at indian delhi palace & i had more fun at delhi palace cuisine of india  with the price a little high at $999 for lunch & both of these alternatives nearby i can only give royal taj 3-stars my girlfriend and i were craving some indian food so we looked up this place on yelp and decided to hit it up while we were in tempe we ended up getting the lunch buffet which was overall just ok  the saag paneer was disappointing while some of the curries were way too salty   however on the plus side the garlic naan and the chicken tikka masala were delicious and the chicken tandoori wasnt bad  also the service was very friendly  it may have just been an off day but i can only only give it 3 stars amazing food top two in az for indian [other being star of india in ahwatukee] i love that they have paneer tikka masala on the buffet every day butter/tomato sauce and you get to enjoy it if youre a vegetarian! sooo good they also usually have delicious renditions oif saag paneer daal mahrani[sp] chicken vindaloo and chicken tikka masala i try not to eat commodity meat so i tend to avoid the chicken sometimes i cannot help myself and i go for the vindaloo sauce which has sad-chicken juices in it so tasty :\the biggest drawback to the place is the service dont get me wrong its very friendly and well intentioned but it totally lacks in that fluid excellent service that can elevate a restaurant experience the owners handle the service [as well as seemingly everything else] and this can lead to occasional long waits to get your check or have your card run theres also a language gap which would make it difficult for somebody who doesnt know indian cuisine to get informed answers to questions about the menuits also as other have mentioned a bit of a bummer to me that they have a full bar and yet i cannot imagine that if i ordered a drink other than a rum and coke theyd possibly get it right i know most people dont go to indian food to get sauced but its always nice to have the option particularly if theyre going to have the full bardespite all these negatives i still rate the place tops second only to star of india [where the food is at least as good if not slightly better and everybody speaks english fluently]i recently moved very close to this place which has been a real trial of temptation so far ive limited myself to no more than twice a month but im not sure how long i can keep up that level of restraint :] im giving first place back to royal taj after less than stellar experiences at guru palace (60 and gilbert) and taj mahal (mcdowell and scottsdale) royal taj is getting back my vote for the best indian restaurant in the valley in case you havent followed my reviews im an indian food connoisseur and have been to nearly indian restaurant in the valley in my opinion royal taj guru palace and taj mahal are in the top 3 indian restaurants in the valley im not one of these clueless guys who judges a restaurant by how many selections were offered at the buffet its about quality not quantity and i dont eat at buffets because you are getting the watered down spiceless stuff they serve to the mainstream  the food was truly outstanding and i think word is finally getting around because the place was packed the chicken tikka masala got the perfect blend of creaminess and smoothness to the curry that guru palace and taja mahal lacked the palak paneer is the best in the city and its truly unique in that they dont mix cheap pieces of broccoli and pure into a soup its the real dealreal spinach with no filler the naan was excellent as always everything is pretty good on this menu again the only knock on this place is its ambience its a hole in the wall but then against so are most chinese and mexican places (the good ones anyway) so if you are truly about great indian food come here royal taj is great indian food i was never a fan of indian food until a friend took me to royal taj and made me order the chicken tikka masala boy was i suprised it was awesome and the garlic naan we ordered with it was yummy be careful if you dont like spicey food because i ordered mine medium spice and iit still made my nose run a bit royal taj also has a 999 lunch buffet that is pretty good for the price the food on the buffet isnt as good as if you order fresh off the menu so dont judge royal taj on the buffet alone ive tried a few other indian restaurants since i started loving royal taj and have not found one yet who has a better chicken tikka masala if you like indian food royal taj is a must try garlic naan is wonderful  had the chicken biriyani lamb vindaloo and chicken tikka masala which were all great  we asked for the food very spicy and it was exactly that  service was great glory be to tandoori eeei heart this place so much and that means more than you raj rani is the cutest i swear she is hopped up on ginkgo biloba because you can come in with a party of 6+ and she never forgets the whos and the whats appetizers are mehbut the chicken fraizee and chicken tikka are sexlectric get the tikka and you will understand special naan is flipping good as well but i usually go with onion kulcha or pudina parantha the bar is shiny and someday i will drink to drunk herebut i will not over do it because the last place you would want to be flailing around would be the ladies room stall yesit is still thereits gone from disgusting to endearing my favorite transition actually  i have come here hungoverits a miracle really sweet lassi will cure many an ailmentthe sticky balls are delish but if you go during buffet hours your balls will be hot i prefer them chilled better for the syrup i highly recommend this placei wish they were open for breakfast oh lord what a good place to get some yummy authentic indian food i went there with a friend upon entering i was instantly transported back to some of my indian friends parents restaurants from my chidlhood the ambiance is from another time which can be good or bad depending on your perspective the owners serve the food and are very kind and attentivewe ordered some samosas which were delicious we then had chicken tikka masala my favorite it was so creamy with tender chicken pieces just melting in my mouth we had rice with it and both garlic and plain naan so tasty very good quality food an older woman who reminded me of mom came out and asked if we wanted rice it was very sweetat the end of the meal we were blessed with sweet balls ( :) i cant remember what they are called) these were on the house and were absolutely wonderful as well i have to say that i really dont have any complaints i also didnt find the neighbor hood to be all that bad we went there around 6p if you are in the area and looking for some great indian food this is definately the place actually i would probably drive a good distance to go here yum yum yum this restaurant is too close to my house to be a good thing love their samosas chicken tikka masala garlic naan bread lamb vindaloo and everything else ive tried here staff is really sweet lunch buffet actually has spicy things on the menu we walked in at 9:45pm and they close at 10pm the owners were so kind and accommodating we had an order of the garlic naan it was the perfect mix of chewy and crunchy we decided to split an order of the chicken tikka masala with a side of rice it was wonderful! the spice was just right and the flavor was perfect i have been thinking about it ever since when we were finished we had a great chat with the owners and they brought us some honey balls they were served cold and finished the meal perfectly who wants to meet me there now? im hungry [3 stars by phx comparison and 2 overall] my quest for indian food in the valley continues call me spoiled but i have had some great indian food (on and off a buffet) and everything after that is relative i also learned to make a few of my favorite dishes for those times i lived in the boonies and couldnt easily get my indian fix craving indian food for sunday brunch i recall a restaurant that many of my friends have tried and enjoyed royal taj popped in just after noon its not busy the ambiance is warm and cozy i request a booth and decide on the buffet it is small but contains the standard fare basmati rice saag paneer a lentil (dal) dish a chickpea dish veggie pakora masala paneer chicken tikka masala chicken vindaloo and tandori chicken a sign above the buffet says that garlic naan will be served at the table picking up my large plate and put rice at the center and put a little of just about everything around the outside to try as i served the saag paneer i noticed i didnt see the chunks of paneer i often do with this dish (maybe they blend it in) plate full and serving myself up a cup of warm chai (included at the buffet) i sat back at my booth shortly there after my naan arrives hot and fresh i pull apart a piece crispy on the outside and soft interior the garlic not as prominent as i would have liked but as i would find out soon the naan was the main redeeming quality about royal taj five stars for the naan!! the rest of the food was lack luster not bad just not that good even by phx standards the pakora were stale and the masalas thin my relative favorites from this buffet were the chicken vindaloo the saag paneer and the chickpea dish these were seasoned well although i missed the chunks of paneer in the saag they had 2 of my most favorite desserts on the buffet kheer (sweet rice) and the gulab jamun (pastry balls in a cardamon honey syrup) the kheer appeared strangely thick but i didnt think much when serving it when i finally got to the table and had a bitedid they use yogurt or buttermilk? there was a strange cultured milk flavor that was not typical of most kheer needless to say this was the first time i didnt finish my kheer (when often i go for seconds) the gulab jamun on the other hand were great homemade soft and melted in your mouth 5 stars for the galub jamun the buffet was @ $11 with tax which is about average but high considering the quality was just barely ok my search continueswhich several other places in the valley yet to try i doubt i will be back i  really miss this place since we moved to california it is owned by a lovely couple who treat you as though you are their only guest even when they are really busy the shrimp korma is my fave and my husband favors their chicken tikka masala i can also never say no to there aloo gobi definitely worth checking out so for dinner tonight i decided that i was craving indian food i have tried several places here in tempe and while i enjoyed one of them the rest were fairly mediocre so i decided to go to the indian restaurant with the highest ratings so royal taj became my destinationi was definitely looking forward to my meal and trust me it did not disappoint the service was excellent and just the right amount of attentive and time spent away from the table no one ever just refilled my water they asked and then polity reached to get the glass i was even offered more ice!as for the food i bought chicken tikka masala (medium spice) and garlic nan the rice that came with the curry was perfectly cooked so was the nan which was simply deliciousthe curry was amazing the sauce was rich and flavorful the spice level was perfect the chicken was nicely cooked and tender it was not dry this was hands down the best indian food ive had since i moved to arizona i came here tonight with my friend on one of our worldly eating adventures i thought it was very good! the place isnt super fancy inside or out but the service was fine and attentive and the food was good we shared the lamb vindaloo (spicy) and chicken tikka masala (medium) along with some rice and garlic naan so first they brought out the indian equivalent of chips and salsa it was a crispy thing with a green spicy sauce and a purple sweet and spicy sauce which were both good then we got the food well i was not a huge fan of the lamb i thought it was spicy but didnt have the flavors i really enjoy in indian food it was just kind of spicy and boring the tikka masala was delicious however it was creamy and flavorful with just a little spice i would probably order it spicy next time the naan was good but nothing super special when we were done they brought out a little free dessert which was like a pancake puff ball soaked in syrup pretty good stuff i thought the place was pretty pricy but thats kind of the way it goes with indian food overall i thought it was a good experience and i would definitely come back oh my god i consider myself an indian food freak and this is by far in all my travels the best chicken tikka masala and garlic naan that i have ever had period the basmati was also cooked perfectly i am super picky for sure ask my dinner companions i wouldnt shut up about it and then they tried it and agreedthe service was spot on even though it was late at night the server even steered a friend away from a dish that they had but admitted wasnt exactly fresh and offered a great alternativethis is going to be my new go-to for indian food! this is by far the best indian cuisine in the valley -and i have been to several trying to find a good once since moving here 5 years ago!  they are hardly busy -so you get right in and sit to eat immediately -great for a work day lunch as it is quick!i have only attended during the lunch buffet which is always phenomenal!  they always have the following on their lunch buffet menu (i frequent often!)chicken tikka masala -my fav chunks of white meet in butter/tomato saucetandoori chicken -chicken grilled in a kiln with onions -moist and yummypaneer masala  -goat cheese cubed in the same great butter/tomato saucethe fried veggie crips are delish! (cant remember the formal name)basmati rice (so tasty you could eat it by itself!)kheer --best rice pudding ever! (besides moms! :-)gulab jamun -little donut hole type treat soaking in a light syrup -yum!and this is a small sampling of what is on the buffet!service is fabulous and they are very friendly -but bewareif you come in often enough -they treat you like family and will remember your fav drink and offer to bring you one when they greet you! i have always loved indian food and having tried in several different countries dozens of different restaurants and nearly every meat and vegetarian dish this cuisine can offer i can wholeheartedly say that this restaurant was beyond my greatest experiences with indian food outside of indiayou have to go into the restaurant expecting a family run restaurant atmosphere this is by no means a 5 star restaurant its a 5 star experience its like visiting your grandmothers house for a home cooked mealthe chicken tikka masalas and paneer are all to die for i asked for my dishes extra spicy and after a brief oh no not indian spicy argument from the owner i received my dish just as hot as they would serve it to a native delicious!the garlic naan and other breads (parantha etc) are great and all deliciously homemadethis restaurant has been around for a long time and if you havent tried it yet its a must stopped in for lunch today based on the raving reviews of the place  cant say i was disappointed necessarily but i wasnt blown away eitherthey brought out naan which was pretty good and i ordered a diet coke after asking if they had it (and they said yes) but come to find out it was actually diet pepsi this is a real pet peeve of mine  they are absolutely not the same and when someone specifically asks if you have diet coke the answer should only be yes if in fact you have it  would diet rc cola or diet shasta have been ok?  why then is diet pepsi ok to substitute? alright im done with thathad the lunch buffet which honestly didnt have a whole lot of selections  the typical fare sag paneer dal lentils (?) some delicious potato thing and my fave chicken tikka masala  there was another chicken dish (which i dont remember the name) but i did not like the flavor at all something was just off with it  im hoping it was just some spice that i hadnt had before (although ive had my fair share of indian cuisine)anyway overall not bad but i wasnt too thrilled to get the bill and see that the lunch buffet is $10 (considering it was kinda limited and after all its lunch how much can one person eat)  i think there should be a blanket rule that lunch buffets do not cost more than 8 bucks max (and $7 would make me happy)  maybe thats just me  my fave indian place in mesa is $10 for dinner and you get way more selectionso bottom line the food was good but not spectacular  if i happen to be in the area and really craving indian i wont say no but im not driving out of my way to go here i came back here for lunch the other day with my mom and we both had the lunch buffet it was ok but was not as good as other indian lunch buffets in the area the buffet only had vegetarian and chicken dishes and none of them were exceptional the chicken tikka masala (which i liked when i had ordered it at dinner) was bland at lunch the buffet just didnt have a lot of options and the options that were there were just ok additionally it was kind of expensive i dont like how dark and dank this restaurant feels either i say meh to this placesorry guys! the best chicken tikka masala in the valley! we often get carry out but the lunch buffet during the week is a fantastic option to try new dishes i agree with the others there often isnt many others there but it isnt because the food is poor try it you wont be sorry! as i read through some of the previous comments i notice a similar story coming upthe food is great the service and atmosphere are horrible  i too have been a patron of royal taj for over 10 years and have watched the owners become more bitter and rude with each year passing  even the food has slightly changed throughout the years  the chicken tikka masala used to be their signature dishnow it looks and tastes like precooked and reheated food  what really changed things for me was placing an order on the phone and when i picked it up the manager raj rani gave me the food charged me full price and acted rude (as usual)  i checked the bag and noticed one of the items i ordered wasnt in the bag?  i asked if i could get the extra item i had ordered and she smiled at me and said we dont have that today  why wouldnt anyone have said that when i ordered it?  why wouldnt the manager offer something else if they were out of an item? why would you sell something to someone on the phone charge them for it and then act like its no big deal when you dont give it to them?  ill tell you whycause they dont care  neither do i anymore  apparently they dont need the patrons money anymore  i wont visit their dark and grim establishment ever again love this place my boyfriend and i come here often because we just crave that chicken tikka masala they are famous for the server is old and sweet always quick to laugh and smile good for authentic food and a traditional atmosphere dont come here looking for fast food but for flavorful food and an experience soo yummy! ive been to several buffets and have had many homemade meals at friends houses this buffet is very good not sure where the bad reviews are coming from? the food is very flavorful the best is the fried vegetable that is a circle (maybe eggplant?) the mushroom mattar and chicken tikka naan is not that great but everything else is so satisfying and good! i cant wait to go back oh they arent open for buffets on monday anymore (found that out the hard way),4.222222222222222,27
Origin India Restaurant & Bar,underwhelming while i was thrilled to see new unknown (to me) items on the menu nothing was particularly stand out i was most looking forward to the vegetable nilgiri as id never had an indian green curry but it turned out to be on the bland side even though id asked for medium hot in fact there was very little spiciness to any of our dishes i also had the yellow dahl which was fine but also not terribly spicy my accomplice for the weekend said the same about her chicken makhani (origins version of chicken tikka masala) but we both loved her mango beverage which turned out to the highlight of an otherwise uneventful meal i would use this place as an indian back-up if the curry craving ever hit or to introduce a curry neophyte to the cuisine as its a rather calm and beautiful decor we found the restaurant using the yelp iphone app  my girlfriend and we always i make it a point to try out a local indian restaurant when were away from home  weve been to tamba in the past for buffet and it was ok  we were greeted warmly when we arrived by a well dressed host for a friday night dinner  we were expecting another hole-in-the-wall join but to our surprise the ambiance was fantastic  dimly lit very elegant  apparently the restaurant is modeled after their restaurants in london  i played it safe with a chicken tikka masala dish  they got this right and more  i literally licked my plate clean because the sauce was so delicious   it was that good  the bartender the waitress the host and even the chef took a moment to stop by at our table throughout the evening to check in on us  i was really impressed by the service  it  is so uncommon to see especially at an indian restaurant  the customers at the time of our visit were a diverse group of people with an indian family at the large round table in the corner  overall i would highly recommend this place to those who are visiting las vegas and love indian food  origin india is clearly in the running for best indian cuisine in las vegas  you will be delighted by their service and will enjoy the food  if youre reading this on your iphone just go  get directions from your currently location now! origin india is las vegas only slightly elegant indian restaurantas such it doesnt offer the nearly standard lunch buffet and features higher prices than you might come to expectwhat it does offer is very good food and a very nice atmosphere if you are into that sort of thingmy chicken tikka masala was above average as were the samosas and our side order of butter paneer wife wasnt as impressed with her vegetarian dumplings 3 1/2 stars tipping just toward 4 the most horrible and terrible experiencei went to this place with my family for lunch buffet the buffet is over priced $1499 per person and the following are the items in buffet1 veggie soup - flavor less and watery2 cheap appetizer 3 chicken tikka4 steamed rice5 lamb curry6 fish curry 7 veggie curry - no salt and veggies were uncooked and raw8 lentils - flavorless no salt 9 rice pudding service is very bad there was a middle aged waiter who has an attitude problemthe decor is good and looked expensive and therefore it seemed they want to feed customers garbage at expensive rate and make up for the decor cost for the kind of money they charge i could have had better meal in one of the casinosthe very thought of this place enrages me and my family because we spent nearly $100 for this crapwill never ever go to this place the owners of this place i love indian food let me start of saying i first discovered indian cuisine years ago while working in an indian restaurant in nyc which was a great gateway for me to try everything (hello menu sampler) i gained a whole new respect for food after trying it indian food can accommodate the meat lover (love me some lamb vindaloo or lamb korma) or the vegetarian alike (saag paneer etc) dishes can range from spicy to hearty to sweet and differ regionally just as american cuisine differs from coast to coast being an indian food lover i refuse to go to the buffets in this townso since shalimar closed its only location next to firefly on paradise i was out of options i ended up reading some reviews and forced my then boyfriend to try it when you first walk through the doors its upscale and very beautiful kind of like an more upscale baluchis to any nycers reading this we sit down and a very helpful server recommends a glass of wine and cocktail pairings after i tell him what were ordering (because of course i already know what i want!) how amazing is that? i love when a server is good at their job and we accepted his recommendations so we start of with naan mango chutney raita and 2 cocktails i ordered lamb vindaloo and he had chicken tikka (i told him that was the safest bet for first timers) the lamb was amazing and the vindaloo wasnt so spicy that it was over powering his was perfectly cooked as well and actually liked mine better ha! the service was prompt and we always had enough water and drinks to never have to ask for anything the waiter was quick knowledgeable and we never felt like we were being pushed into ordering anything mind you its not cheap to really enjoy yourself and your date itll probably cost you anywhere from $60 - $80 gratuity included ( by enjoy yourself i mean getting naan (bread) chutney (dipping sauce) an app like samosas 2 entrees and 2 cocktails)upon leaving i got an origin india card where i get a discount and im signed up for events they do there like tasting events they got a new chef a while back and changed the entire menu recently and i havent a chance to try it lately i looked online and saw that they have a chef tasting menu that is chalk full of 5 courses for $45 per person not bad you will definitely see me there again because i am 100% positive that the food remains to be fantastic its a great date place to add a little exotic and unexpected to your nightly game plan for the adventurous couple or tourist if there is a single phrase to describe this place its a bit too : dimly lit much vinegar in the chicken tikka caesar salad dressing expensive the service is gracious my curry lamb stir fry entree was excellent and it was served with rice - the poppy seeds are a nice touch the actual chicken in the salad was delicious and tender but the caesar part is taken too literally and definitely more than a take- note: nobody actually wants to pay good money for a standard caesar salad   although i would have liked some naan bread to go with it but i did not think it too fitting to pay for an additional item for a meal that already totaled more than $30 when my purpose is to dine catch up on the news in the paper and go  on that note its probably a decent place for a date what with the mood lighting attentive service and attractive setting what happened origin india? you used to be so good! so this is my first time coming back here since feb of 09 post their new chef and menu changes im disappointed because they were so good and the service was so amazing before and this time around it was just notmy friend and i walk in get seated and are immediately approached by a waiter inquiring on our water preference we receive our menus and start talking and realize that we have no drink menu okay? dont the two usually go together? mid conversation were interrupted by another waiter after we just looked at the newly received drink menu we said we need more time and he saunters off the menu has become this bizarre fusion without the proper names of the dishes so its like uh what? basically they give you the recipe without saying what it is my friend ordered the chicken tikka salad that was served over a minuscule bed of coarsely chopped iceberg and romaine and i ordered the lamb curry stir fry which was really lamb vindaloo we ordered some samosas and apricot and raisin naan to start the waiter inquires how spicy i wanted the vindalooo and i say as spicy as it gets and that we would like the naan and the samosas to start please tell me why it took 10 minutes to get our cocktails in a bar that was not busy? i mean literally the bartender was just standing there doing nothing and there was no one at the bar when we received our cocktails that were $10 in small martini glasses we were less then impressed i ordered the orange peace margarita and my friend ordered a blackberry pomegranate concoction we both slowly drank them but they were not that good so our naan arrives at the table as well as our samosas in a little tower shape with a nice presentation the flavors were good albeit dry 4 minutes after that he brings the chicken tikka salad to the table after he asked when we were taking our order if we wanted the salad with the samosas or with the lamb we said with the lamb since that was her entree after 5 additional minutes obviously my lamb wasnt coming and he forgot they were supposed to be served together so she ate and i just sat there fun times after she was done the lamb got brought to the table and i literally could barely eat it my fault because i said as spicy as it gets but that was ridiculous i can usually take spicy but damn he asked how everything was i said really really spicy and he brought over some raita  it still wasnt good after that and when he inquired later on how i was doing i still said its really spicy and he awkwardly laughed and walked away he didnt ask do you want me to have the kitchen make another one for you? nope he just giggled and walked away wtf?! now i could understand if i ate half of the dish but i had a little corner of my plate with the lamb on it and some rice it felt like it was his first waiting tables job and it was just off yes the waiter was nice but it felt like a poorly operated faux fine dining experience they were not trained properly on etiquette nor timing we paid our $60 bill and left i boxed up my vindaloo and took it home and ended up just throwing it away anyway because i knew i wasnt going to eat it i just couldnt justify spending $21 for something and not eating it oh and also the lamb didnt come with rice it was a $3 upcharge ridiculous after the great experience i had to that is just disappointing and it was my birthday last night to boot im kind of undecided if i want to go back after that i have to admit i am a food network fan so when i saw rachel ray review origin india so highly i got the idea to treat my wife to a nice dinner a bit out of our usual price range she loves indian food and it was her b-day so we splurged i made online reservations but they were not needed at all the place was all but empty we had to wait while the manager interviewed a prospective employee but that turned out bad voices were raised and we were caught in the middle oh wellthe ambiance was nice the lighting was low but not like dining in the dark like some places i have gone as we were seated we were given the wine and drink menu and the dinner menus a quick note: the menus were dirty and stained from drinks or whatever this was immediately off-putting because in a place with as high a zagat rating of 26/21/21 i would have expected more ok maybe i expect too muchso the option bottled or lv tap for water let me say up front i am not paying $800 for a bottle of pellegrino (price not listed so i am assuming)  that is $200 in the store local is fine thank you am i cheap? no i am in this restaurant but i am thrifty no need to be hosed then it took 5 minutes just for water to be served and another 10 minutes for iced tea the tea was a black tea refreshing but not unusually soi think the staff had to be bored as we had like three different waiters i was not certain who was serving what and that felt a little odd we went on to order the raisin and apricot naan which was delicious and an appetizer of chicken tikka that was very good i am not sure it was actually chicken tikka it was not spicy at all except for what looked and tasted like spice grape leaves holding the appetizer to the plate but it was goodthe entree for me was a moulard duck leg confit coated in ginger garlic cinnamon honey and orange zest served with butter poached potato and sweet and sour kumquat marmalade and my wife had southern indian style diced lamb stir fry diced lamb stir fry with curry leaves black mustard seeds whole kashmiri chilli and coconut served with lemon rice here is where origin india shined both plates were wonderful to look at and the taste was marvelous they have earned the 26 zagat food rating (should be 27 in my book)for dessert we tried the indian donut holes and while tasty a bit of a disappointment oh wellthe atmosphere was disturbed while we were there by a guy yelling into his cell phone if i had my way cell phones would be discouraged in a fine dining establishment they are so annoying but management just let this guy yammer away even when they saw the dirty looks we and others in the restaurant were giving himin all our dining experience was about two hours and that was expected i have to admit that although the food was superb they overall experience lacked polish that for the prices charged i would have expected they attempted to provide a high dining atmosphere but fell short on the details like not replacing silver in a timely manner and by letting drinks to be emptied before refilling i did not expect the classic crumbing the table but the little things seemed to add upif the prices were a little more reasonable for the experience i would be a frequent diner but the tab was a bit too steep to make it a regular thing first the real bad the service is slow and a bit inattentive our lassi took forever we didnt get napkins until after our appetizers which didnt come with any of the typical chutneys now the not-so-bad we ordered the mater paneer which was good not great and the chicken tikka masala which was runnier than expected and the chicken a little dry the flavor was good but a little too garlicky the samosas were the best part a little spicier than normal which was a pleasant surprise the mango lassi was spot on the naan was solid and they offer a variety of naan flavors that can be ordered in one basket finally the chutneys once they arrived were a bit off too much mint in the mint chutney for one thing if you like indian food this origin is as good as it gets all the meat is halal which is nice but if youre a practicing muslim if not then you have to order some cocktails off the very creative and extensive list created by resident bartender joseph hes crafted some very complex drinks using the same herbs spices and ingredients the cooks are using in the kitchen  i recommend the black mamba if youre getting something hearty like the lamb or chicken tikka the cucumber pearl was light and  perfect for a vegetarian dish the lal dupata (red veil) was also very good  with the chicken curry we had a few more but i dont recall the names keep in mind these take a few minutes to makevery well done in the kitchen and the bar! the absolute best indian food in las vegas  the best appetizer is the lamb seekh kebab  so tender (i recommend getting extra mint sauce)i love this restaurant because i can take first timers as well as friends that love indian food  some of my favorite entrees are chana massala (vegetarian) chick peas cooked with tomatoes and various indian spices  delicious  i prefer it pretty spicy but i hear its also tasty when mildthe new zealand lamb shank is absolutely amazing  the chicken tikka makhani is probably the most popular and best dish for beginners  if its your first time i suggest getting a few family style dishes to share so that you can sample some of everything   my friend and i were in the mood for some indian cuisine 4 stars on yelp is pretty good right? unfortunately the best thing that can be said about this place is it has a nice interior more upscale than your typical indian establishment otherwise the food was decidedly mediocre and the service was absolutely atrocious some of the worst ive experienced in a long time but lets start from the beginningon a big banner right outside the restaurant they advertised a 3-course dinner for two for $2999 upon inquiring about this option our waiter informed us that special was no longer being offered and theyve been meaning to take it down however they did have a 5-course tasting menu served family-style for $45 per person! now either the waiter was bullshitting us or their website which advertises the same special is out-of-date as well either way this is what you call a classic bait and switch and false advertising! we should have taken the hint and walked out then but we were hungry unfortunately this same thought would be a recurring theme throughout the rest of the evening so we asked what was included in the 5-course tasting menu and were not terribly excited by what we heard and it didnt seem worth anywhere near $90 for the two of us we asked for a few more minutes to peruse the menuafter about 5 minutes we decided to get the sweet apricot and raisin naan ($4) chicken tikka makhani ($13) seven spice veal ($25) baby eggplant ($11) and 2 side dishes of chana massala and aloo gobi ($7 each) oh and we had to pay another $3 for a single order rice because none of the entrees came with any! we ended up waiting another 15 minutes before another waiter spotted us looking a bit perturbed and asked if we needed anything we told him we were ready to order i thought he was going to take our order but instead he just told our original waiter that we were ready and would be right with us our waiter was running a couples credit card with one of those portable terminals right at their table after the receipt was signed the waiter continued to idly chat with them for another 5 minutes or so then our waiter disappeared into the kitchen or god knows where for another 10 minutes before finally coming to take our order he apologized for us waiting a few minutes (yeah right try half an hour) i would be more understanding if they were really busy but less than 1/5 of the tables were occupied i know i know we shouldve walked out alreadyso finally our order is in but we wait and wait and we wait some more we continue to watch other customers who sat down after us and ordered after us get their food first and in one case actually pay the bill and leave! at this point i am so incredibly green with envy of the customers who have the other waiter after about half an hour they finally bring out all the food at once at this point we were absolutely ravenous but our spirits lifted in the hopes that it would be worth the waitunfortunately while the food satiated our hunger pangs it was substandard indian fare the naan was not crispy at all but rather thick and gummy it didnt contain very much apricot or raisin and no chutney tamarind mint or any kind of condiments were offered the chicken makhani usually one of my favorites was kind of bland it lacked the spicy complexity that a good curry should have the chicken didnt seem to be marinated at all it was dry and was probably cooked separately and then tossed into the curry at the end the aloo gobi was mostly potato and contained very little cauliflower we both got bitefuls of undercooked semi-raw potato as well the chana massala veal and baby eggplant dishes fared no betterduring this time no one stopped by to ask how the food was nobody offered to refill our nearly empty glasses of water until we were ready to pay the check after asking for the check we waited over 15 minutes before our waiter returned and was expecting to collect the check when we explained that we still had not received the check he disappeared for another 4-5 minutes before finally returning with our check we usually pay via credit card but decided that we better settle up in cash lest we want to spend another half an hour waiting i almost never leave no tip but im thinking this is one of the rare situations that qualify however my friend lobbies hard to leave at least 10% as were walking back to our cars a black crack whore tries to solicit us ah a fitting end to such a memorable evening!heres the executive summary: nice interior ambiance over-priced mediocre food horrendous service i am sorely tempted to give this 1-star but since the food was at least edible (except for the undercooked potatoes) i suppose it just barely merits 2 stars take my advice: save your money and time dont do it just go somewhere else like mount everest namaste or samosa factory when eating at a restaurant most americans would classify as ethnic i judge it firstly by the patrons  if the people dining there are of the same national origin as the food i know it is going to be authentic  this was the case at origin india last night  the majority of diners were indeed indian  my roommate and i went last night  as we walked in we were greeted by a lovely hostess who was very friendly and seemed surprised that i had made a reservation  hey i saw the option on the site and gave it a shot  a reservation really was not necessary though  there were plenty of open tables in a restaurant that from the outside looks small  just because there were plenty of tables available does not mean there were no diners  there were several tables being used  as we were seated towards the back of the restaurant i looked around and quickly felt relaxed  it was dimly lit and i could hear indian music playing softly in the background  on the table was very heavy silverware and giant fancy folded cloth napkinsour server was very attentive  he came by frequently to ask if we were ready to order and again to check if we were enjoying our dining experience  we were  i ordered the chicken tikka makhani in the entree size (smaller portion served with rice)  my roommate ordered the family size home style chicken curry  we both ordered naan  i got the wild mushroom naan with truffle oil while he ordered the fresh garlic naan  it was not unlike a good fresh pizza crust  it was fluffy with a slight chew  very good for sopping up the left over sauce from the meal  my makhani was good  the chicken was very tender  the sauce has a great spice  the basmati rice was light and airy  amazing  the chicken curry was good as well  the sauce had a strong tomato flavor  it was not quite like spaghetti sauce but reminiscent of though it had a curry taste to it as well  what made the curry good was the fresh cilantro added on top  it was refreshingi am going to give origin india four stars today though 35 would be most accurate  the service could not have been better  the food was very  i enjoyed it thoroughly  it is  however priced high for the amount of food you receive  i was not starving when i got home but i was not full either  for $20 a person i expect to be full upon leaving and have leftovers to take home as well  this was not the case  had it not been for my groupon offer i would not have eaten here  for this i must demote them to a 35 star rating fantastic place real indian flavourswe ordered sag paneer oven baked eggplant and chicken tikka masla and each bite was delectable! amazing! origin india is my favorite indian restaurant in las vegas  although you will pay a bit more for the food here than many of the other indian places it is well worth it  the atmosphere is serene and the restaurant definitely is well kept and clean  the food is always fresh ingredients are top notch and the presentation is amazing  the service is very attentive alsosome of the items that are exceptional include:  chana massala kebob platter samosa chicken tikka makhani and of course the garlic naan had garlic naan and chicken tikka and it was very good the sea scallop app was greasy and overpriced overall good meal ive been to oi several times over the years and it seems they get better each time  i think they move back and forth between old school and noveau but each time its been delicious  their staff is well trained  to interpret customer nuances and are very knowledgeable in their craft  last meal? veg samosas ( non-traditional but tasty wrap scrumptuous filling) and chicken tikka (perfectly grilled seasoned and juicy)  followed with delicious saag paneer (cheese quality was phenomenal wonder if they actually make it in house or they buy it) and the kabob platter scooped with plain naan  i was not that impressed with the lamb but still goodand the tikka this time around was just a bit dry  those two details and the slightly higher prices (with a la carte breads & rice) may take away a bit but not a full star  great meal great service very comfortable and tasteful ambiance (definitely indian yet with a very crisp feel)  every meal? maybe notbut definitely perfect for a night out or special hangout  well done oi! this is my go-to indian place  they have deals on groupon most weekdays--$15 for $30 worth of food  thats more than enough during lunch when they have their lunch specials: 2 appetizers 2 main dishes and 2 desserts  during dinner i use that to order my usual: veggie samosas chicken tikka makhani basmati rice and 1 side or dessert  very filling!  the samosas here are well made and not as greasy as other indian restaurants make them  the manager is a very nice guy!  he remembers us each time we visit  i had bangs then no bangs between 2 visits and he didnt want to say welcome back! to my boyfriend because he thought maybe he brought in another girl!!  i found it hilarious  so the manager has your back haha  the wait staff is very prompt w/taking your order refilling drinks and getting the check to youpricey w/o deals from yelp or groupon but still worth it either way i guess this is the french culinary approach to indian cuisine: very light and delicate flavors compared to the more rustic indian restaurants ive encountered i would say the food here is bland but if i had no point of reference from which to stake a comparison id say the food is tastefully seasonedi started with the grilled paneer tikka appetizer: a mildly seasoned tower of fresh cheese i loved getting little flashes of char from the grill on my tongue the tikka sauce was sparingly placed on the plate it was satisfying yet light and also not terribly flavorful i had the chicken tikka makhani as my main course paired with the garlic naan it turned out to be tasty but once again lacked any real punchthe dining atmosphere is quiet and elegant with a pleasantly minimalistic decor i would eat here again the menu options are unique and id like to explore them a little further however i left the restaurant feeling slightly ambivalent about the food maybe one of these days ill drop back in: after ive forgotten how unmemorable it was we were not actually planning on eating here tonight but as we walked by the smell of the indian food was just to good to pass up now we have our regular indian restaurant that we love but that is on the other side of town and we were meting friends close by so origin it isthe decor is nice the private dinning areas are very nicely done a different tone from the normal indian restaurant for sure it would echo what was to comeif you are expecting your normal indian restaurant menu youre in for a shock however on closer inspection the regular menu items are there just hidden behind the words of someone who had way to much time on their hands when the menu was put togetherfor example :old delhi style corn fed chicken tikka makhani prepared with ground spices and fenugreek flavoured tomato makhani saucethe vast majority of indian places would simply call that chicken tikka massala  but you get my point study the menu and the regulars are there also the wait staff were more than happy to run through the menuthere are also some non-standard dishes but those will have to wait till next time as we were really in the mood for indian comfort foodso chicken tikka massala and chicken korma were ordered along with a couple of plain naan and one wild mushroom and truffle oil naanthe food took about 15 minutes to come out of the kitchen it then dawned on us both that they had not asked how hot we would like the curries mmm could be an issue i like mine hot but the wife likes hers very mildluckily for us they were both mild but then again (indian food eaters are laughing) a massala and a korma really shouldnt be that spicy anywaysthe plain naan was good the mushroom naan was very good it actually made for a nice combination when eaten with the massala sauceas frank s pointed out below the flavours are very light and delicate now imho this is not a bad thing especially when first being introduced to indian food the korma was actually spot on the massala needed a little more flavour to be just rightso would i recommend origincertainly it is a decent indian restaurant and even more so if you are just stepping into the wonderful world of indian cuisineare there better in town yes are the worse in town oh yeah good:1 food is pretty good2 prices are reasonable for indian food3 good service bad:1 if you get there at a certain time they will make you wait until that times menu is available im not a fan of indian food my tongue cannot handle the spiciness this food typically contains however i was in vegas and this town is about leaving your ol self at home and trying new experiences so i walked in to the restaurant and they were celebrating an event they server told me that i had to wait til 10 pm to place my order i waited patiently and one of the owners came over and apologized he went ahead and took my order i tend not to eat fish anywhere so he recommended the old delhi style corn fed chicken tikka makhani prepared with ground spices and fenugreek flavoured tomato makhani sauce served with pulao rice i took it to go when i got back to my hotel room i seriously prayed it would not be too spicy i grabbed a spoon and went for taste:ummm not bad hot but not wait crap spiciness coming in wheres the rice? found it! oh! yeah thats better not bad ok lets continue so it was basically like this for the rest of the meal; 1 or 2 spoonfuls of old delhi chicken and rice overall i would def come here again it is the only place ive found myself liking the food ive gone all over the world trying indian food except india came here for some take out the other day and had the ol wtf?! moment when i got home heres whythe cabana salad with added chicken tikka ($1050) was disturbingly poor first off for it to be even a $8 salad (w/o the chicken added) is insulting its similar to a side salad you get at mcdonalds (yes this exists) it even had shredded cheddar cheese on top ill repeat this cheddar cheese and chicken tikka together why? to boot the tomatoes were wilted the chicken tikka was dryer than a popcorn fart and i would comment on the dressing but they forgot to give it to me so know this going in they cant even make a salad right and it costs over ten dollars  the rest of the meal was a step up (how could it not be?) from the salad the chana masala was average (a bit greasy) and the naan was baamb my advice? grab an order or two of naan and dip it in your fave sauces at home better yet find a place that makes great naan and something else to dip it in next! the food was excellent  mysis in law had chicken tikka masala and said it was excellent  my husband and i had the baigan dahiwala  im a wimp and ordered it at 0 heat  they did an excellent job of doing spice without the heat  it was delicious!  the garlic nan was good but the onion kulcha was exceptional  the service was less than stellar but the food compensated  the food at our table was overall a thumbs up the good stuff firstnice décor great samosas and chutneys great chicken tikka masala (sp?) the badthe awful shrimp dishspiced just right but the shrimp was overcookedhow muchobviously reheated or held too longlike biting into a whole water chestnut i should have sent the dish back did mention it too the waiteroh i will tell the chefno response at all from managementwere busy bsing at the bar lesson learned by mejust return the bloody dishjust hate doing that thoughwould i go backyes definitely,3.5833333333333335,24
Indus Village,i come from a chatty family  with that said my sister always meets someone interesting when she flies -- shes so outgoing!on her flight here to visit me she met a man from bangladesh that lives in chandler  during their discussion she told him of her love of indian food and he told her about this brand-new indian & pakistani restaurantthis place is amazing  the decor is really beautiful -- the tables have these colorful carved wood chairs  very unusual but very prettywe opted for the buffet -- its nice to have variety and it gives you a good idea of the caliber of a place -- and everything was awesome  one of the first things i tried was indus chicken  it reminds me a little of tandoori chicken -- it doesnt have any sauce -- but different  it was incredible -- really tender and i dont know what the seasoning was but it was so yummy i wanted to roll myself in itthe chicken tikka masala the paneer tikka masala aloo gobi rice raita okra and chickpeas -- everything was wonderul  then there is the naan  oh holy mother of god the naan  hands down the best ive ever had!  with that said it was a *little* pricey -- with the buffet and drink it was about $18 (without tip)the owner of the restaurant was so friendly -- very chatty -- loved hearing about how my sister heard about his restaurant  most of the people eating there were south asian -- so you know it rocksi dont live close to chandler but i will be back and often!  if you love indian food i implore you -- run dont walk to this restaurant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  just remember to go hungry - it may be a little expensive but its so worth it! i first found this place in may right after we moved here so my review is probably overdue  its a long interesting story of what-did-happen i thought i wrote one already anyway we were in the first week of a month-long hotel stay and always looking for good desi (particularly pakistani) food so we walked in to check it out not planning on staying for dinner at that point but the owner was so friendly and welcoming we changed our minds fast i would recommend the buffet over the menu unless theres something specific you want - its varied with a lot of dishes to choose from things i particularly liked - the chicken tikka which is not completely covered in spice so you can really taste the grill of the meat instead of gulping water frantically you dont find that in a lot of places there is sometimes music on weekends - best to call ahead but it really adds to the atmosphere - very cool the other thing i specifically wanted to mention was the lack of yogurt on the buffet when i didnt find it (my 2nd time) i asked for some and was given a huge cereal bowl full - it was so delicious i had to eat the whole thing it was homemade fresh every dayothers have covered the decor completely authentic - very nice the owner told us the furniture (chairs at least) came directly from pakistan ive been here about 4 times now and it is always a fallback also during ramadan they offered free iftar food every night this restaurant is actually the second one with the same name and management - the first is in berkeley ca and has been there for years wonderful to find it here too!if you have the slightest interest in pakistani / indian cuisine try this place - im pretty sure you wont be sorry! i looove this place!thank god it just around the corner from my house  their menu is small but everything on it is delicious  the chicken tikka masala sauce is delicious - i could just drink it by itself mmmm  the aloo baingan (excuse the spelling) is awesome!!!  the prices are also amazing dinner meals starting at 699 (entree basmati rice naan and dalmmmm),4.666666666666667,3
Imans,my first trip here was for an office xmas night out and it surpassed my expectations!! we were loking for a byob indian and so decided it was worth a try based on some good reviews there were 30 of us in total ans its xmas party season so i guess i was prepared for things to be a little chaotic but was pleasantly surprised when there was a number of staff ready and waiting for us! we had been placed in the back room which on the plus side is private so we could be ourselves and not have to worry too much about whos next to you my only complaint was that it was probably a bit too small for us and we did feel a bit crammed in - however that seemed quickly forgotten when the staff arrived with plates of poppadoms and dips and of course plenty corkscrews to assist us in opening wine!! we had the 3 course festive menu at £1750 per head and im still struggling to figure out how they managed to make a profit from it the deal included poppadoms n dips the restaurant then provided everyone with a rather generous plate of starters including pakora samosas and bhajis each with a small side salad - each item was a good size and everyone managed to clear their plates - good start! being gluten free i made them aware and was treated to my very own selection of gf starters including chicken tikka lamb skewers and bombay potatoes - fantastic! for main everyone was asked to choose what they wanted from the a la carte menu (nothing was out of bounds and there was a fantastic range of chicken lamb and seafood dishes!) i opted for one of mums home cooked specials (desi saag chicken) which was really tasty and spicy but not overly so this was accompanied by as much white and brown rice and naan breads as we could eat (and boy did we give them a run for their money but it just kept coming!!) dessert was ice cream but with their very own ice cream shop next door and 24 flavours (turkish delight seemed popular) we were not disappointed!! throughout the meal the staff were really friendly struck a good balance of being there when you need them but lft us to enjoy our evening even when the singing started towards the end they were fantastic!! it made for a fantastic work night out and evryone was ravving about it at work after with many (including me) definately planning a return visit!!,4.0,1

Tandoori Village,since i cant study right now i might as well write the review of the restaurant that is to blame for my current state  i took a dinner break and met a friend of mine at tandoori village  i was thrilled since i havent had indian food since moving to arizona  i still cant smell quite right but even so i could tell that this place smelled goodnow the other reviewers are right with one thing  the place isnt much to look at  but its not a theme restaurant or some fancy-pants hipster fusion restaurant so im not gonna knock it for that  they were playing bollywood movies on the tv and that was enough for meif you like nan its good enough here to make it worth the trip  we had some potato some onion and some garlic nan  ive never had garlic nan before  it was one of the most garlic-y things id ever eaten  aside from the fact im gonna kill any vampires within a mile it was fantasticthe main dishes were all also good  the chicken tikka masala and chicken curry dishes were delicious and had enough kick that it helped clear my head  and the paneer was a wonderfully mild contrast between the two spicy dishes  all the food was presented well (as well as indian fod can to be fair) and everything was cleanfor what we paid we got a lot of food  even so the late-evening food coma thats keeping me from studying may cause some grief later  ah well at least it was for a good meal after living abroad for a few years a favorite treat for my husband and i became indian food once we moved back to phoenix i was determined to find a decent indian restaurantafter trying several disappointing restaurants throughout the city i am pleased to say i found an excellent choice a few minutes from my housethe restaurant is usually near empty when ive gone in for dinner that worried me at first but now i consider it an undiscovered gem i was glad to see that a buffet was not offered because in my opinion quality matters more than quantitymy husband and i order the same dishes every time we dine here my husband is iraqi and a lot of indian cuisine mirrors some of his favorites although he has tried a couple of different items in the past we always orders lamb biryani and naan there is definitely no shortage of food here we are stuffed silly by the time we leavemy favotie dish to chicken tikka masala with a (massive) side of rice it doesnt get any better in my opinionthe decor is plain and the staff isnt overly friendly the service isnt impeccable but the food compensates for it my wife and i just moved to this area from the east valley where we were near the best indian restaurant in the valley in guru palace at baseline and gilbert rd  this was some of the worst indian food ive ever had and this is in no way to demean the amazing meal i had there but i have had better indian food at taste of india in fargo north dakota we got take out so i cant speak to the atmosphere but when i walked in there was one other person there and the owners the garlic naan was more like pita bread it didnt feel or taste like it was cooked in a tandoor and was thick i would say they bought it somewhere and just reheated my wife got the staple-chicken tikka masalai make better chicken tikka masala the jew from ny makes better chicken tikka masala then tandoori village there were 8 count them 8 chunks of chicken and a sauce that was filled with whole spices and the wrong kind of chunky no onions no peppers just bits of bay leaf and whole cardamom pods it was pretty gross i ordered the tandoori lamb chops as im a lamb lover and thought this would be a good thing to try since i dont see it on too many menus my $14 dish was 3 skinny chops and one massivei dont what kind of portion that is but its not a $14 dish portion this was our first and only time being a patron of tandoori village i cant wait to try tandoori times as its closer and has to be a vast improvement on this awful meal very disappointing taste presentation of dishes is very bad ambience is ok service is averagethis is in comparison to so many indian restaurants we ate in usdine date : 2012feb10hope they improve it soonfull details below:4 of us went 2 vegetarians and 2 non-vegetarianspakoda -

nice taste and proper quantitybasmati rice - not properly cooked is cooking plane rice so hard??soft drinks - they do refill it but the soda doesnt have proper soda in it its like as if  you leave a coke bottle open for 1/2 hour and drink itpricing - reasonable and equivalent to other indian restaurants service - good the waitress is very presentable doesnt bother to give us choices also doesnt bother to tell our specific needs to the cook seriously?? i can have that in a buffet or in a fast food jointfinally my friend giving us the treat decided he will take us to a better restaurant again everyones disappointed,2.5,4
Chennai Chettinaad Palace,tried this restaurant on a wednesday nightwe didnt encounter any of the issues the other reviewers had service was fine our waitress was attentive friendly and prompt there were only a few other diners present (many indian so thats a good sign!) decor is ok felt a little 80s to me but the restaurant is spacious and the backs of the booths are high enough that you cant see over them (a plus) bollywood music videos show on a couple of tvsfood was a couple dollars more than were used to spending but i had the chicken tikka (dry) off the appetizer menu - which was entree sized and my friend had a cauliflower curry (gobi) the vegetable samosas were good and they offered us a variety of chutneys which were more like sauces than a traditional chunky chutney - tomato mint and coconut (all good) garlic naan was good toobiggest complaint is the use of plastic dishes and why there are chinese food options on the menu is beyond me stick to one cuisinewe both agreed the food we had was good and wed consider returning here -delicious chicken tikka masala-nice decor-lots of vegetarian options-spicy (if you request it)went there for the first time with my boss and a group of coworkers from india we had the lunch buffet and the food was very good sadly they didnt have golab jamun (the fluffy cheese balls soaked in syrup) neither i saw the free chai most indian buffets have (i like both because in other indian buffets i sweeten my (free) chai with golab jamun syrup) well fulla as review says this is food from the chennai area maybe chai and jamun golab are not from there : (ok back to the food they had interesting and varied options all of them very tasty and also had good options for vegetarian dishes (paneer dishes and vegetarian biryani)i dont remember the names but i tried almost everything and it was very good they had like 3 different chicken dishes 2 soups salad and various other itemsand they bring potato dosai to your tablethe hubby and i went there for dinner last night they only seem to have the buffet for lunch so we ordered from the regular menuwe shared chicken tikka masala (it comes with white rice) and garlic naaneverything was very good the chicken tikka was delicious the sauce was the tastier and creamier we have ever had i noticed it had like pieces of green herbs usually the tikka sauce in other places is just orange-like color this one had dark small piecesservice was good as well our hostess and server were 2 young girls and they were very polite and stopped by several timeswe will be back even though it is quite a drive we went here last night for the first time and had a fantastic dinner my husband ordered a spicy vegetable soup and we got two orders of chicken tikka masala he didnt like his soup and said it tasted like spicy water with some spices so we will try something different next time the chicken tikka masala was awesome but the rice it came with was pretty bland although i felt it was fine when paired with the masala the garlic butter naan we ordered was seriously amazing! and dipping it in the tikka masala sauce was the best part of the meal our server was very sweet and very efficient however they were definitely understaffed for the amount of people dining i think she may have been serving most of the tables in the place so it took a little longer to get everything than it probably should have but it was never so long that it was ridiculous the restaurant itself is beautiful very clean and well designed you would never be able to know such a nice place is hidden in the shopping mall there was plenty of open parking and it seemed like the place didnt get busy until 8:30ish; definitely a later crowd our price for the soup two dinners naan and 20% tip was $45; which was very reasonable we will absolutely be back soon! went to sunday lunch buffet buffet opened at noon 13 usd per personthe chicken tikka masala and paneer butter masala were flavorfulthe potato was nice toothe naan was perfectly texturedtheir atmosphere is classy service is pleasantthe water does not taste like tap water and is actually tastes like soft mineral water (not iced)i think my boo and i were the only non-indian/pakistani there lolclean fresh 13 usd for weekend lunch buffeti would def go again i think i found myself a new fav place i took my spouse out for indian food this evening  rather than our usual we wanted to try a new location and chennai chettinaad did not disappointwe tried a variety meat and vegetarian dishesthe chicken tikka masala was flavorful and mildly spicymy go to heat dish lamb vindaloo was flavorful with tender chunks of lamb while i had ordered the maximum spice level what i received was a mediumwe also ordered a vegetarian dosa which was done with the same level of care as the other dishesthe last dish ordered was biryani the biryani was a solid good  i look forward to seeing what it is like with added heatthe service at the restaurant was good to very goodall in all a very charming restaurant whose attention to detail showed in everything from the excellence of the dishes to the decor this place is somewhere that i will not return after seeing reviews here i thought that going to this restaurant for the lunch buffet was a good idea however a good portion of the food was not palatable dishes that were okay:- the rice- chicken biryani (cold but flavorful)- chicken tikka masala (some of this chicken was very overcooked but at least palatable)- naan- gulab jabun (like a donut hole - delicious)dishes that were not decent:- appetizer (some donut looking thing)- paneer mutter masala (this is usually one of my favorite dishes but was disgusting!)- fish (i dont know why i tried fish at a buffet but not impressed)- curry chickeni thought just the service would be bad and it was i was expecting that did not get a refill  this was somewhat expected with the comments on here that i read before choosing this restaurant i can totally accept poor service if the food tastes good overall i paid 1409 for this meal and did not even eat a full plate because unfortunately on the two plates i did have not everything was worthy of being put into my body as it would taste so bad going down i have been eating indian food for over 10 years i love it and this was such a sad food experience after spending the past summer in berkeley and thoroughly enjoying all of the fabulous indian restaurants there it is so disappointing that it so extremely difficult to find a decent indian restaurant in the north valley the last time i enjoyed indian food in phoenix area was when i went to tempe but that is too long of a journey from where i live now the struggle to find decent indian food in the north valley continues but i know that i will definitely not be going back to this place,3.6666666666666665,6
Sai India Curry,wow  serious hole in the wall!  decor is nonexistent  service is functional  the buffet is okay  the selection was intriguing though--they served a squash curry and an okra/onion curry the day i was there as well as the inevitable lentil dal rice chicken tikka masala tandoori chicken vegetable pakora pappadum naan and chutneys  nothing was extremely spicy and some of it needed a little more kick  nothing was so outstanding that id return for the buffet but there was an indication of enough potential that ill certainly return and try something off the regular menu,3.0,1
Maharaja Restaurant,i stopped in for dinner while i was in madison for training now i must say i am a sucker for indian buffets i love them all even if i dont know the name of any of the dishes so it was a feat that on this night it was the first time i was actually picking out individual entreesi read the takeout menu about 40 times until i saw a couple of things that looked familiar i felt like a nervous little school boy taking my first test finally i just went up to the waiter at the desk and asked for his recommendations a few minutes later chicken tikka masala nan and samosas were ordered then the waiter gave me crayons and a coloring book and told me to go play just kiddingthe food turned out to be really good samosas were really flavorful and not too greasy it went well with the sauces that were provided - green mint sweet diced tomato and a plum? sauce nan was on par with the high recommendation of the chicken tikka masala i expected to be knocked out instead i just got pimp slapped across the face it was still good but not 5 star goodoverall this was a definite good find i will surely update my review once i hit up the lunch buffet i am a believer! i finally got to try the buffet let me tell you if eating until it hurts is wrong i dont want to be right! they had all the staples (tandoori chicken chicken tikka masala) as well as some new items ive never tasted chicken 65 was the most notable - kinda like crunchy bite size pieces of tandoori chicken except spicier dessert didnt dissapoint either; there were at least 5 you could pick from the most notable were the mango ice cream and carrot halwanote: lack of samosas and palak (spinach) paneer didnt push my rating to a 5 there is hope however! i did go on a thursday for the lunch buffet; the weekend buffet is supposed to have more offerings im not indian but ive tried really good indian food and this place is pretty good!i always get the the two dishes that can never go wrong which is the chicken tikka masala and the tandoori chicken ( sorry if i spelled that incorrectly) anyways this place also has really good rice its actually flavoredoverall my favorite place to eat in madison so far i wanna gonna give 4 stars because the food was excellent but the service was terrible so minus one star for that the place was crowded and they didnt have enough waiters when i asked the waiter to take a photo of me with the food he said ok and never came back when i asked for the bill the waiter forgot i ordered wine and they never brought it i had to remind them that i had ordered winethe food however was excellent the daal was very tasty and the chicken tikka makni was amazing the mixed tandoori platter seemed really popular i saw many people order plate after plate of meat on a sizzling hot plate so i ordered it too and it was so tender (you get chicken shrimp and beef)bottomline: come here when it is not crowded all the previous reviews are spot on we loved this restaurant best indian food weve had in years we had cheese pakora mulligatawny soup chicken tikka masala tandoori chicken and aloo gobi it was all delicious but the tandoori chicken was the best   and naan cant forget that would definitely come here again friendly staff we mentioned we were passing through and he said he knew we were newcomers the others in the restaurant were regulars (some of whom were indianwhich is always a good sign)stop here for good food woe is me what took me so long to discover this place? and to think all the times that ive craved indian food maharaja was just a short drive awaymy friend and i ordered the chicken tikka masala (mild) the fish curry (medium) and the regular naan our entrees came with a side of rice and a complementary flatbread appetizer served with tamarind sauce and two types of chutney (onion and cilantro) while the portions are small the food is very filling - probably on account of all the carbs! :pas for our dishes the chicken was a little tough but otherwise well-seasoned i really enjoyed the creamy tomato base and i was glad that i ordered it mild instead of medium because the medium fish curry was really spicy i was a huge fan of the battered catfish cooked in a garlic/ginger sauce but i could only take so much heat :( service was impeccable our water glasses were always filled quickly and plates were cleared off the table as soon as we were done with them the staff continually circulated by to see how we were enjoying the meal and seemed genuinely interested in any feedback we had about our dining experiencejust an fyi the online menu is a little outdated i wanted to order the chana masala but it wasnt an option on the restaurant menu fortunately you really cant go wrong with any of the curries or masalas! give em a try! :),4.166666666666667,6
10-to-10 In Delhi,what can i say about delhi that hasnt already been said? its really lovely gorgeous cozy decor - bright hangings comfy pillows thrown about would really warm up a windy edinburgh afternoon delicious food - tried the lamb samosas and chicken tikka masala and they were both great generous portions as well - and the prices so sinfully low i felt a bit criminal like i was robbing the place the service is very friendly and courteous and theres a great selection of teas itd be a lovely place to while away a rainy afternoon sipping on tea and nibbling on poppadoms - if you can get a table it gets quite busy and rightfully so,5.0,1
Jewel of the Crown,chutney !!!chicken tikka !!!chutney !!!chutney !!!:) one of the better indian food places in the valley lavish enough to sit and pass time (family or friends) except for items above nothing happens to be very great as such but overall nothing happens to be bad too ohh yeah and one more thingchutney !!!chutney !!! i discovered this jewel while looking on the internet for indian food near my office and was very pleased  while dinner can be a little pricey lunch is extremely affordable  i loved the chicken koorma and the chicken tikka masala  naan was fresh baked and delicious and was great mixed with saag paneeri have introduced a  few friends to it now as well who love it too  the service depends on who your waiter is  i have had good service and poor service but will keep returning for the food ive been to this place a couple of times for dinner and lunch and it never lets me down  the chicken tikka masala and chicken saag are my favorite dishes and some of the best indian food in phoenix  i just wish they had more options for lunch specials!  some people would say the dinner is a bit overpriced but it feels you up and the flavors are worth it  i will definitely keep coming back i used to work nearby and would visit jotc weekly for lunch it was never very busy and the lunch waiter would recognize us and get us everything we needed quicklythe keema samosas are delicious!if you are new to indian food i recommend the non-veg thaali it has an assortment of tandoori chicken curry a veg dish naan bread yogurt and rice pudding - all for $10my favorite dish and the one i ordered every time was the chicken tikka masala its like $15 and doesnt come with naan or rice but its worth it its a lot of food and it makes me oh-so-happy everytimeby comparison the lunch chicken curry special for $8 comes with rice and naan the rice pudding is excellent as welli will miss jotc! i really enjoyed their chicken tikka masala lamb saag (maybe spelt that wrong) and a simple made mango lassi here with the 20% discount here it is totally worth it! (believe me i have had horrible indian food) good indian food not great  came in on a saturday night was craving indian  not busy at all  (never a great sign)  the samosas were the best in town piping hot with a great filling that was redolent of spicies and not super mild like some other restaurants  the lamb korma and chicken tikka masala were okay  for some reason it didnt pop for me  it had nothing to do with the spiciness level it was just missing that extra pop you get from a truly great curry  i dont know if the spices hadnt been freshly toasted or if it was lacking a crucial pinch of love that day but i wasnt feeling it  i left full but not quite satiated of my indian food fix  and the quest for the best chicken tikka masala in town continues(oh i should mention the interior of the restaurant is beautiful the service good but the prices a little steep for my taste) dh and i came here tonight to use or groupon weve been coming here for the last 20 plus years and it use to be our go to indian restaurant! after the visit tonight we will never be back we got our dishes medium and spicy but neither had any flavor we had an eggplant dish and chicken tikka masala as well as kebabs soup and dessert we decided to splurge and get the $50 dinner for 2 food was terrible as was the service people who had come after us who had also gotten the same dishes and the dinner for 2 left before we had even finished our entrees server was so swamped that he had no time to come and check in on us to see if we wanted anything else or to see if we were doing ok there was also a hair in the rice dish we will never come back! as other reviews for this place go taste of the food is good decor and ambience not so much chandeliers had a few fused bulbs not replaced during dinner that does bring down my mood a little bit we found the prices to be a little steep $1599 for each curry was a little too much our bill for 2 people a la carte came up to $70 approx we had chicken and vegetarian dishes chicken tikka masala veg samosa shahi paneer onion kulcha veg biryani quantity of food on par with the rest of the indian restaurants in the valley if not less we went there after reading other yelp reviews about the food a long drive from north valley( the restaurant is located on scottsdale rd and indian school rd) hardly worth the drive and the cost of the total bill my husband had the veg biryani said it tasted like paella a spanish rice dish and he wasnt satisfied with the taste of his chicken appetizer eitherno issues with the curries though tey could have been spicier thanks groupon and yelp for introducing me to this place i probably wouldnt have tried it if there hadnt been a groupon and probably wouldnt have bought the groupon without reading the good reviews on yelp this place is pretty hidden so you most likely wouldnt find it unless you were looking specifically for it i love indian food though there arent a whole lot of options for it in the area especially in old town the first time i went there was an office christmas party going on so we went and got some beers at ott first and then came back and even though they were still pretty busy they were accommodating both times we got the kabobs as an appetizer and split the chicken tikka masala and both were really good one entree is enough for two people to split for sure the garlic naan is also the bomb and last time we were there we got some mango ice cream for dessert and it was really good havent been disappointed by anything there thus far they have a patio and an inside area which is cool because i love patios and i also like options if you want to get in and get out go around 6pm otherwise it will get pretty crowded also they give you some stuff to munch on when you first sit down which is always a plus in my book went there yesterday night (8/9/13) because we purchased a groupon now i am not one of those people who by default think that all indian food in the valley is horrible because it does not compare to my moms cooking i am judging this place based on other indian restaurants in the valley and the quality of food quantity of food - really good ambience - very nice the decor is nice and pretty i liked it service - decenttaste of food - it was really bad i am sorry to say it was boderline inedible we ordered the chicken tikka masala 2 plain naans and chicken biriyani the chicken tikka masala was too tomato-y all i could taste was an overpowering tanginess from the tomato paste and it wasnt pleasant the chicken wasnt soft and tender and flavorful either the chicken biriyani was similarly tasteless the rice in the biriyani was clumpy and overdone you know that is a cardinal sin while making biriyanioverdone rice!!! the naan wasnt like a naan at all but more like tandoori roti my point in writing this is really to inform the owners i think that with a little bit of tweaking of the food this place could be excellent!  but unless they do that we are not going back again i do not know why people would ever give this place low stars jewel of the crown has been one of the best indian restaurants in the valley they use really fresh ingredients and their food does not have that overwhelming richness most indian food usually has im indian and this food is a replica of what my mom makes! amazingmy favorite dish is the chicken tikka masala! it is amazingly good and what they are known for! everything is priced fairlyafter all you are in old town scottsdale all the other restaurants are the same atmosphere is so beautifuleverything is nice and clean too unlike some other gross indian restaurants overall excellent!!!

Delhi Indian Cuisine,where shall i begin food is excellent nice atmosphere service is great the staff is very friendly and informative for first timers to indian cuisine the chicken tikka masala was my favorite dish along with the yellow fried rice okay so i just dont get the hype i was really excited - i mean indian buffet good reviews sounds like a recipe for success it was okay and cheaper than other places at $999 but i think i would pay the extra few dollars and go a block over to mint in a heart beat yes the buffet takes up length wise over half the restaurant but what i didnt care for about this place was that it lacked variety - you have the standard tandoori chicken tikka masala etc  but maybe it was a busy day before i got there giving them the benefit of the doubt but i had to fish around in the sauce to find pieces of chicken and not only in the tikki masala but any dish which contained sauce and meat dont get me wrong i love sauce but i like to find that there is ample meat to accompany my sauce also there was something about the ambience that felt cold - maybe it was the poor acoustics which made it feel very big and open but not in a good way or the just the set up but somehow the dining room was not overly inviting although that in itself is not something that would normally concern me - hey if the food is superb ill eat it sitting on a street corner (as used to be the case with viva las arapas before they moved) nonetheless i thought it is something that should be noted service was average nothing outstanding we did request garlic naan and they brought it my friend asked for lemon wedges for water they forgot had to ask again and then they brought a plate of lime wedges from the salad bar maybe they dont have lemons? on the upside i got a free mango lassi which was tasty with yelp check in - so thank you delhi indian cuisine for that treat so overall i wish them good luck and i hope that they make it as i do with all restaurants that are not chains but unfortunately i am going to stay loyal to mint for lunch buffet and mt everest as a second choice after reading so many reviews my bf and i finally tried this place out last week we had the lunch buffet and i was surprised by the variety of the different foods of course our first question to the owner was if the meat is halal or not and it was!! *halal alert* the food was delicious everything from the reshmi kabob to the warm gajar ka halwa they had chicken tandoori (flavorful!) goat biryani channa masala and the list can keep going on and on we also ordered garlic naan (including in the 10$ buffet price) and it honestly seemed to come right out of the oven! i couldnt get enough of the chicken tikka masala and the navrata korma (i think thats the name? lol) the sauce (salan) was creamy and hot it became obvious that this place is going to be very popular very soon we talked to the owner and he was very helpful he told us that although the main items stay the same during the lunch buffet sometimes the dessert (mithai) might change and maybe the lentil curry (daal) the atmosphere of the restaurant was quite fancy and quiet on the day that we went but they have a very nice setup im itching to come back again! :) spectacular place!! must go my husband and i came here for dinner our first night in vegas  our dinner was so delicious that we decided to come back again the next night! this was the best indian food we have had compared to places in san francisco and sacramento ca it has delicious food great service and good prices the restaurant is also nice and cleanthe tandoori chicken was fresh and sizzling when it came to our table the meat was tender and falling off the bones! we also had the lamb curry chicken curry and chicken tikka masala all of the curries were amazing with just the right amount of spices the staff was friendly and accommodating we will definitely be coming back here when we visit vegas! enjoyed a delicious dinner here cant wait to come again and enjoy the lunch buffet chicken tikka was fabulous as was the chicken kadhai okra masala was delicious   i suggest you give the kashmiri naan a try  it was to die for,4.4,5
Star of India,its been almost two years since i last visited star of india and my absence is due to other reasons and not bec of the food  some good eats ive tried here are the chicken tikka masala basmati rice and chicken naan the latter of which was overflowing with chunks of tender marinated chicken  add a side salad and youve a delicious meal went here for the lunch buffet which was about $12 a person  the papadum were nice and light the pakora were cold and soggy of the two chicken dishes in the buffet i tried the chicken tikka masala which was ok instead of having the chicken korma i had the vegetable korma which was tasty my favorite of the vegetable dishes was the chickpea dishes which had a bit of spice to it but was not overwhelming or overly spicy - i would have liked to try a spicy dish i was disappointed in the sag paneer - usually one of my favorites but hadnt tasted one like this - not sure why i didnt like it as much as  i usually do it tasted like spinach and a little mint of something like that but couldnt figure out the rest of it  the other vegetable dish was oka couple of minutes after we sat down freshly cooked tandori chicken and nan were brought to the table both were tasty i tried both of the desserts - the galub (i cant remember how to spell the rest of it) and the rice dessert - both were very sweet and tasty one of us had the mango lassi which was sweet and good  overall the buffet was ok - dont know how long the food was sitting out so i cant comment on thati think i would come back for dinner to order from the menu instead of having the buffet again  i gave three stars more because in comparison to other chandler restaurants its a bit better than what ive been having here lately - as far as compared to other indian restaurants ive been to out of state - this was a little disappointing ill try something from the menu sometime to see how it compares to the buffet ive lived here for three years and this was my first visit to star of india not sure what took so long other than i had no idea it was here  buried in the back corner of the strip mall in ahwatukee that houses the trader joes i frequent (thats where i procure my cornbread and my tea tree lavender liquid dish soap among other staples)anyhow i give star of india 35 stars the food was great and the digs were what you might expect them to be for an indian restaurant buried in the back corner of a strip mall in ahwatukee: simple but clean we didnt come here looking for a scene we came in search of fine ethnic eats so the modest decorum was cool by us and the eats were indeed fine and ethnicthe staff was friendly i do have some advice for our server however: you have a nice smile and were seemingly helpful in making suggestions from the menu but try being a little more reassuring once i settle on something i have enough uncertainty in my life example:server: how spicy do you like your food on a scale of one to ten?me: (thinking gee this is nice im used to the one-to-five scale offered me by most thai restaurants there must be a favorable exchange rate right now what with the economy and all) i like my food mild to medium so lets say fiveserver: are you sure?me: ummm  i think so is that considered mild to medium?server: is this your first time eating here?me: yesserver: you may want to go easy thenme: so  three?server: really?me: (thinking dont do this to me i have enough uncertainty in my life) i dont know again its my first time eating here so i dont have a barometer by which to measure your one to ten scale what do you suggest?server: five should be good for youme: (perplexed) thats what i was originally thinkingserver: do four thenme: (again thinking dont do this to me i have enough uncertainty in my life) lets go with thatserver: positive?me: (really unsure now) yes!the aloo parantha was great to start with its like naan only whole wheat and stuffed with potatoes and green peas tasty my chicken tikka masala was very good although i will do five next time alexis s had vegetable korma and they were very accommodating so as to prepare it without nuts (something she has grown increasingly intolerant to especially recently sigh lucky me) i snuck a taste when she bent down to pick up her napkin it was excellent the korma i meanuncertainty in my life aside one thing im fairly certainly certain of is that im pretty sure well be going back to star of india i must try the korma next time and yes im sure! (i think) not by any means an indian food expert nor have i been to more than 3 indian places  i was craving some naan (that awesome flatbread) and talked to my good friend (whos sikh) and he recommended this place as it was local to me and he had had a good experience there - and if he says its good i listen  she even asked me on a 1-5 scale how hot i wanted the food 3 totally but could have done 4 probably :)its in a dark corner of the plaza and the price was higher than i was expecting but the food totally made up for itthe safest thing i could get is chicken tikka masala which tears me up anyways but i love indian food (dont think indian food is meant for skinny white guys just sayin)  bottom line girl on phone was very helpful and very nice the guy at the front desk was very welcoming and nice and they even offered me drinks for waiting like 3 minutes for my food to be done (was doing take-out)  felt very welcome there and everybody was friendlygot home everything wrapped and sealed up nicely as for no spillage in the car and the naan was wrapped in reynolds wrap food was great bread warm and fluffly chicken cuts were very tender and moist and the rice was perfect flufflinessim totally going back but i need to give my body a break im payin for eating indian food  but it was so worth it! i loved this place the minute i stepped in the door!  its fairly small beautiful inside & very comfortable & cozy  the lighting is just right & indian soft jazz & soft rock playing in the background were not offensivethere was no soup which would have been nice but after the standard indian salad i dug into chicken vindaloo malai kofta (vegetable dumplings in a sauce) alloo kobhi yellow dahl & more unusual treats along with the usual basmati rice good chicken tikka masala & so on  along the way my very friendly & attentive server brought me a plate of hand prepared tandoori chicken  that was a nice touch & it was moist & good!  almonds in the rice pudding for dessert made it extra good toothe great atmosphere food & service here make it one of my favorite indian lunch buffet places here in the valley!  its $999 i almost feel guilty writing a review for star of india since i frequent this restaurant at least once a week  obviously im a fan  the owners who seem to spend their entire lives at the restaurant are some of the most welcoming and thankful hosts ive ever run across  this is one of those small family owned restaurants that i feel proud to support   dont get the impression that i would rave about a place if they didnt have the food to back up their hospitality  im fairly certain i tried just about everything on the menu  my favorites are the chicken tikka masala and the saag paneer  my wife and girls really enjoy the paneer tikka  samosas malai kofta and the shahi paneer  my oldest daughter has developed something of a reputation at star of india as the gulab jamun girl  each time she comes home from college we pay them a visit the owner cant resist bringing her ridiculous numbers of these desserts just to see the look on her faceif youve never tried indian food before this is a great place to start  ask for preet and hell be happy to help you pick something that meets your tastes 5 star service 45 star food overall a super enjoyable experience  well definitely be going back!my boyfriend and i went to star of india for dinner  i got the chicken tikka masala while he got the channa masala  my chicken tikka masala was absolutely perfect all buttery with tender chicken and a spiciness that was tasty and not overwhelming  his channa masala was really good -- he asked for medium spiciness and it was considerably spicier than my mild we ordered a parantha and a naan to go with our entrees when the very nice owner asked us how our meal was my boyfriend offhandedly said the parantha was a little different from what he was used to that its not as fluffy and tender as parantha from other cultures  the owner immediately set out to find us a bread we would like giving us a free order of roti and free order of rice to pack with my to-go box for my chicken tikka masala  the owner was gracious and eager to please and really fun to chat with  that made all the difference and with the great food well definitely be going back!  ps get the gulab jamun -- its delicious! this is by far my favorite indian restaurant in the phoenix area and the best!the food is very delicious and the owner preet is very hospitabletoo bad i no longer live in ahwatukee  all i could think of when i was at a restaurant down the street from my place earlier is how mouth-watering star of indias chicken tikka masala is yumm!a must visit! i was unaware of this little gem of a restaurant next to trader joes in ahwatukee and the only reason i ventured there with my wife was that there was a groupon deal for it thanks groupon! here are a couple of things i thought were worth mentioning about my experience:food:i had the chicken tikka masala with medium spice levels and it did not disappoint the curry was fragrant rich and spicy! just the way it should be id be hard pressed to recommend a better indian curry to my friends the garlic naan was also well done and was a decent portion be it for a slightly exorbitant price (more on that below)spice level:spice levels are more spicy than the the typical indian buffet so beware if you have a delicate constitution my wife was tempted to get hot but lucky enough she settled for medium it was just right  for her and she likes spicy foodprice:the meal was a little on the pricey side due to the fact that we had to pay $2 - $5 for rice/bread on top of the entree as it is not included with it onion fumes:while waiting for the food to come out i started tearing and started wondering if i was just having a moment ;) but as it turned out it was onion fumes wafting into the dining room from the kitchen that were making my eyes water yes the fumes were that strong! then again we sitting right by the kitchen door and it was a little stuffy as it was cold outside (winter) and they likely had the heater on i did cease to notice it once the food came though because i then started crying tears of joy whilst stuffing my face nom nom nom!conclusion: i would likely return and bring a couple of friends or family members back with me! this is the best indian food restaurant i have ever been to  i highly recommend the lunch buffett - they usually have chicken tikka masala tandoori chicken and some type of lamb dish that i cannot think of right now  the naan bread that they bring you is also amazing  i have lived in phoenix for over 13 years and this place is better than anywhere else  this the place to go if you like indian food just had them deliver very good chicken tikka very flavorful and i love the garlic naan service: a+ came on a friday night couldnt believe how busy such a small place could be but now i know why was brought a drink while we waited for a table staff was happy to see us and very friendly atmosphere: a+ small restaurant but very cozy and authentic the walls are filled with indian art and the music was authentic and cheerful food: wow! let me say it again! wow! we were first brought out a complimentary taco shell looking appetizer with a few sauces it was delicious i then ordered chicken tikka masala (hot) regular rice and garlic naan i think ive found my favorite food of all time everything was so hot and delicious i will definitely coming back very soon probably twice a week ive eaten at a few indian restaurants most recently the curry corner and this place is hands down 100% better in every way shape and form price: extremely reasonable for the quality of food i heard they even have an all you can eat buffet from 11-2 i will definitely be checking it out soon! overall for me its the best indian food in phx and most likely all of arizona if you are over on 40th and chandler blvd go check it out you will not be disappointed this place has some the absolute best chicken tikka masal in the valley the courteous staff makes it even that much better this dish can range from mild to blow your taste buds hot but they always seem to get it just right unlike other places i would recommend this place to any and everyone!!!! my favorite indian restaurant in the phoenix area  staff are very friendly give good recommendations  everything comes out fresh and hot  theyll make your food as spicy as you can handle  the meat samosas chicken curry chicken tikka masala shrimp korma aloo gobhi naan and garlic naan were all delicious  it does take a little time for food to come out but thats because everything is prepared upon order  have to say didnt want to write this review in hopes the place wouldnt get busier but i have to give them their dues,4.357142857142857,14
Tandoori Times Indian Bistro,alas my craving for indian food came to the point where i had to breakdown and eat indian food on the west coast :(  im sorry to say that my craving for indian was not met and the timing to eat at tandoori times couldnt have been worseto start off my first sign of disappointment was when i called to see if the had a lunch buffetthey didnt  what indian restaurant doesnt do a lunch buffet!?well two to be in exact which happens to be the only two indian restaurants in old town scottsdale (tandoori times and jewel of the crown) which is where i work of coursethe cuisinefirst off im a big believer that you can judge an indian restaurant by their chicken tikka masala so since this was my first visit to tandoori i had to try it   lets just say it was okay at best  the tikka masala was little bit spicier than usual which is fine with me and it also had the right consistency and richness from the cream you expect but it missed the slight sweetness that contrasts the spices from the sauce  disappointingnext was the naanthe naan came out warm and had that ever so slight crispy outside that i adore but the inside was slightly doughy or little too moist which made the naan slightly chewy after it cooled off  it was still good but come on; you can at least master the basics right?wronglets go to the rice  first and foremost i dont ever recall where you had to pay for rice at any indian restaurant  well guess what?  i did  $250 to be exact!!!  and for $250 did they master this staple side dish?  nooooit wasnt like it was horrible but i have never had indian rice that was oily; it was slight but you could taste and feel it  overall texture and flavor was sub par but i couldnt get over the slightly oily taste and texture  all i could think was that i was eating chinese fried rice (b/c of the oiliness) with my tikka masala  sigh oh well  atleast they gave a hearty portiondecor was adequate dark green and red colored sheer covered sections of walls and was used a divider to break up the room  but what was up with the standard white office acoustical tiles in the ceiling?  atleast black it out like most restaurants  i felt like i was at work or in some weird episode of the office  an episode when steve carells character michael decides to go to an indian restaurant at lunch and notices the same thingbut to only make an erroneous comment out loud so everyone in the restaurant could here starts mocking indians and their accent and everything then goes down hill: something i would only laugh if on tv but would not in real life  i couldnt get over the fact that on top of that they had the audacity to then painted random acoustical tiles dark red and blue which made your eyes look up at the ceiling  im clueless on that oneanyways i am very hard pressed to find a reason to go back tandoori times  for all you phoenicians you never had indian food save your taste buds and go to nyc or anywhere back east and try it there  but if you get the urge i would suggest go to india delhi palace on mcdowell road  the food is actually pretty good for az standards that ismore along the lines of 2 1/2 stars food: everything i ate - chicken tikka chicken tikka masala chicken biryani mattar pineer lamb vindaloo mumbai shrimp and garlic naan - were all great i drank a king fisher (indian beer) and it was pretty good better than most american bottled beers mango lassi was good as it is in most places price: its about $9-13 for each dish and $3 for naan atmosphere: decently nice restaurant not very much indian decor the music can get a little too loud right when i jokingly said a belly dancer should come out and dance to this music one actually freakin did a white one it was entertaining and awkward but when a little girl went to dance like the belly dancer that was hilarious i swear that little kid danced for an hour straight service: the waiter who ive seen at campus multiple times was helpful and polite skinny: this is the best indian restaurant ive been to in the phoenix area im going back for sure to satisfy my indian food cravings my belief has always been that at a restaurant nothing matters but the food  service can be abysmal as long as the food is good  tandoori times has changed my beliefs about this and i now realize that service can be so amazingly terrible that it can completely ruin a dining experiencedinner started innocently enough  we sat at a table not far from the bar and our server started out asking us what wed like to drink  the server had a young kid with her maybe 5-6 years old and the kid was helping her with things  i thought it was kind of strange but i assumed it was probably our servers kid and that she couldnt find a babysitter for the night or something - no big deali ordered a dirty martini and our server went back to the bar to mix our drinks (she told us the bartender had already gone home for the night even though it was only 6pm)  since our table was near the bar we could hear what was going on there and within a minute or two i heard the server asking the rest of the staff if they knew where the olive juice was  after a minute or two of searching the staff concluded that they were out of olive juice  at this point i expected our server to come back and ask if she could get me a different drink  she didnt  instead she started asking the staff what she could substitute for olive juice and they concluded that saltwater would be good  ugh  she brought me the drink and pretended it was completely normal and nothing was wrong  i pretended i didnt know any better took a sip of the drink and told her it was beyond awful and it tasted like they had used salt instead of olive juice  she acted like she couldnt imagine why this was and she said that she would take the drink off of my bill  when she picked the drink up from the table to take it away the young kid i mentioned earlier bumped into her and knocked the drink out of her hand  she spilled a bit of it on me and most of it on the floor  she then walked away and offered no help of any kind - no napkins or anything  this spilled drink stayed on the floor _the entire rest of the meal_ and they never cleaned it up  when we eventually left i was tempted to slip on it pretend i severely hurt myself and start yelling about how careless their staff was how they could be held liable for injuries blah blah blah  i just wanted someone to recognize that it was ridiculous for them to not clean up things that they had spilled but it really seemed like they didnt care at allanyway the server asked if i wanted something else to drink instead  i went for a gin and tonic  when she got back to the bar the first thing i heard was whats in a gin and tonic? how do i make one? sigh  anyway the gin and tonic turned out okay all things considered but at this point i was pretty sad from what had already happenedfinally we got to ordering our food  our server came over asked what wed like and as we started telling her we noticed she wasnt paying any attention  she was just watching her kid and talking to her  so we got to repeat our order again and this time she actually paid attention and wrote it down  yayawhile later our food came out - we got two naans (one paneer one chicken) chicken tikka masala palak paneer and rice  the naans were pretty average nothing really special  the chicken tikka masala was actually pretty good and was the only decent part of the whole meal  the palak paneer was some of the worst ive ever had and im pretty sure they just emptied a defrosted bag of frozen spinach over some cubes of paneer  it tasted like no spices or any kind of flavoring had been addedin the middle of eating we were interrupted by the server and her kid for a rather awkward moment  the server made her kid apologize for knocking over my drink and then they walked away  congratulations tandoori times on making our dinner that much more uncomfortableour server didnt seem to care about anything throughout the whole meal - she never asked how anything was if we needed anything etc when we were done eating she came by and dropped off the check without removing our plates from the table or even saying a word  we had been charged an extra $250 just to have rice with our entrees which i think is pretty ridiculous  anyway i took out my credit card and she came by to pick it up again without saying a word  we left quickly wanting to get our tandoori times experience over with as soon as possiblewhen we left i was pretty frustrated and angry which is not how one should feel when leaving a restaurant  i will never ever ever come back here again the atlanta yelp empress kathleen m came to town this week to help out with the yelp rocks event so since shes a fan of ethnic cuisine i decided wed try tandoori times  it is kind of hidden in the shopping center - i suggest they get some better signage  but were smart girls and we found it it looked pretty dead from the outside but once we were led to a table we saw a few other parties dining (including some friends of mine on a date!)while our service was attentive enough our waiter kept attempting to talk us out of what we wanted to order and tried to sell us something different  for example when we ordered the chicken tikka masala he suggested we order chicken chile instead  no thanks!  and when we ordered the bengun bhartha (eggplant dish) he suggested something else too  we stuck to our guns though  we were girls that knew what we wanted!in addition to the dishes above we shared a house salad rice and a tandoori roti (whole wheat bread made in the tandoor oven)  we wouldve ordered an appetizer of sorts (ie: samosas) but you have to do that during certain times of the day and we missed our window for that  (kind of odd huh?!)  nonetheless i enjoyed everything although i added a lot of hot sauce - it didnt have much kick without it  gotta love that hot sauce!i really enjoy indian food and dont eat it as often as id like  it seems that many people are not up for adventurous eating i dont get it!  regardless id come back to tandoori times in a heartbeat  it didnt knock my socks off but it was a pleasant experience with attentive service decent ambiance and moderate prices  thanks to kathleen m for trying something new with me! an indian coworker of mine who was craving a little chicken tikka masala suggested that we check this place out after yelping it so we headed over one night after work it was a little hard to find as others have mentioned but we got there in the end so no harm no foul a lot of my recent indian food experiences have been in strip malls which are about as disasterous as they sound so i was so thrilled to be able to go sit down and enjoy my indian food properly and enjoy it i did!my coworkers and i started off with the bread basket which our waiter kindly let us mix n match: we werent thrilled about the wheat naan so he let us switch it out for an extra helping of the onion garlic or plain naanyippee! all of the naans were greatthe onion was probably the one that thrilled me the least but its hard to go wrong with naan of any variety so needless to say that when our food was gone the naan was as wellfor our entrees we ended up going family style and sharing four dishes (for three people): the chicken biryani chicken tikka masala chicken makhani and lamb vindaloo they were all greati would order any of them again but if i had to choose my favorite it would be the chicken makhani i really appreciate that they use white good quality chickenone of the keys to great indian food in my opinion! the chicken tikka masala was also wonderful as well but spicier than the makhani as for the lamb vindaloo and the chicken biryani they didnt do it for me quite like the first two but i really have no complaints about them and devoured them in no time the service wasnt super-quick but well be back after a great meal we all agreed that this place could easily become a weekly dining excursion especially since they have frequent diner cards!! every time youre there they put a certain percentage of what you spend on the card and then you can use it on any future meal thats fabulous! its like free moneywhats not to love?! my wife doesnt like very hot/spicy food she enjoys indian food and wherever we have lived in the past we have found great indian restaurants able to make her dishes without all the kick  we went here to check it out and she ordered chicken tikka masala and couldnt eat it because of how spicy it was   the manager told her he couldnt make it less potent or else the taste would be sacraficed  well how did the other indian restaurants outside of phoenix manage to do it?  not impressed at all with this place and wont be going back gabi k was sweet enough to cater to my indian cravings and we ventured out to tandoori times on my never ending quest for quality chicken tikka masala as we scanned the menu i was disappointed to see that a large portion of their options were only available during lunch time: get separate menus so im happily oblivious to what im missing! i am a chicken tikka masala girl through and through while i may order other dishes in addition to ctm i *have* to get it at every indian joint i go to yes yes i know it may not be the most authentic thing but i dont care i love it so dont you dare try to talk me out of it! and thats exactly what our waiter did which made me nervous was the ctm all that bad? no it was fair but the waiters attempt to lead us down a different road makes me wonder if they really do have wonderful food here its just not ctm try it out and go with their recommendations! i love this place!  every time i have a craving for indian food this is where i go even though i now live about 40 minutes from here!  the service is always great and the food oh it is wonderful!   i usually order the chicken tikka mahsala or the chicken mahkni  they are both so good!  i also love their naan  ive been to a few other indian restaraunts in the valley al of which were claimed to be the best indian food in phoenix  but this truely is the best in phoenix! service 3food 35cleanliness 4atmosphere 5value 3pros:great atmospheregood first time indian food this wont knock over you friends new to the

buffay crew finally got to me and i had to have it for a cheat meal :)was like mr toads wild ride in my truck getting here a quick u-turn brake check sharp right up a ramp and into a parking place that complex is like a maze and i feel lucky that i located my destinationwalked in the yelp stickered door and was hit with that delicious indian restaurant smell what was lacking was the scent of mesquite which you can usually pick up at most places from the tandoor this was an upclass place so i figured it was just vented well the place was really cool on the inside having this upscale lounge type feel nice and dim and easy on the eyesthe guy who was double duty as host/waiter seemed a bit annoyed that i was walking in the door at 8:45 when they were open until 10 a tad on the snooty side asked if i was picking up or eating in with a heavy insinuation that i better be picking up luckily i was saved by my phone going off as my friend couldnt find the place i got to bark two for dinner and walked out the door to find my friendwas happy when our waitress came to the table since i didnt want much to do with the host she took our drink order and asked if we needed a few more minutes to which i made the mistake of replying yes normally i have these meals pre planned and know exactly what i want but this was a last minute change of destination i regretted not ordering right then because we didnt see her again for a long whilemy friends have learned that i usually know whats good and just let me order for the table one of them was an appetizer and as usual i was asked if i wanted that first or with the meal i try and condense the time that im eating bad food to limit the sugar spikes it might create im not even sure why they ask because 9 out of 10 times they bring it first anyway :( this was one of those 9 times we waited for what seemed like an eternity for this one dish to show up at that point i just started eating because i was super hungry the rest took another 15 minutes to get there kitchen here is realllly slow and we were one of only 3 tablesone more note do yourself a favor and get a table the booths here are horrible they press you forward into the table and are very uncomfortable on the back after a while and you will be there a while :pfood details:onion bhaji:i ordered these thinking they were something different they were basically battered onion strings with what i would guess was a plum based sauce i was expecting the indian fritters that i couldnt remember the name of at the time it was still tastybread basket:sampler of 5 different types of naan the only ones i would recommend are the onion and garlic in the rest the texture was a little different but no flavor profile change and rather dullchicken tikka masala:mmmm i love this dish and it was pretty darn good here i have had better but it wasnt in the valley i havent chowed on much indian since returning here many years agosaag paneer:texturally this was way off from what im used to it was almost like a ground spinach the spice profile of the dish was excellent but i was a little disappointed in the paneer this isnt a strong cheese anyway but this really had no flavor to it im used to it adding at least a creamy/richness to the dish this one had the taste/texture of firm tofutandoori chicken:i was really craving some tandoori chicken and i was disappointed it wasnt bad but it lacked the bold flavor depth this dish usually has i also totally missed any mesquite/wood/smoke flavor that should have been there between the lack of wood taste and smell i think this place may use a gas driven tandoori verses a real mesquite charcoal versionkheer:rice pudding is great stuff and adding almonds and raisins to it yum this is where someone played a cruel joke on us the dessert glass was an odd shape and the spoon didnt fit all the way! if you wanted to retain your manners there was 1/4 of the dessert you were unable to reach manners were tossed out the window :)i agree fully with the 3 stars this place has averaged for itself i made the mistake of trusting some friends over trusting yelp i could have done much better that night but this was a-ok and tamed the craving we felt very rushed towards the end of the dinner to pay and get a move on we were there in plenty of time to eat and leave before closing had this place operated at a normal pacejust remember if your friends had good taste they would be yelpers :) the food was excellent  the lamb chop appetizer was incredibly flavorful although it was a little gristly  the bhindi masala is among the better bhindi dishes ive had  i still cant place the extra spice they put in it  the saag ghosht was superb just really an excellent lamb dish  tender lamb and mildly spicy spinach gravy  and of course the chicken tikka masala was solidand tt serves gajrela an indian carrot pudding  its been a few years since ive had gajrela   i still love it  service was friendly and speedythe belly dancing with the sword was unexpectedmy only concern with tt is that if that was its saturday night rush then i hope they are making it up during lunch  the place was only 20% full my wife and i were looking for a good indian restaurant in scottsdale and came across tandoori times thanks to yelp  the reviews were positive service was question mark  we were prepared for the wait  we went on sat night at 6:30 and sat right down  we were well fed and walking out in just about an hour  the service was friendly and great  the garlic and onion naan were great as recommended so was the chicken tikka masala and lamb saag  we are locals and like some spice in our food  we are used to ordering spicy mexican and it being just right  we did the same here wow they meant it  loved it but had a nice sweat going  we were told after that mild is a 5 on spice meter what we had was 8 out of 10  you might try mild first trip  i did not give 5 stars due to that being a rare mark for off the chart experience like the old sea saw or binkleys  we left with a great dinner experience and a take out menu  we will go back maybe mild next time indian food is not my favorite but i think this is the best place for it in scottsdale  i really love their chicken tikka masala  i also think they have great naan and i like that they have a variety of flavors  excellent chai tea which is free and unlimited  they have lunch specials which is also nice  or you can order anything off the dinner menu all day but you will have to split it with someone because the portions are huge! this is the only india restaurant in az that doesnt disappoint we have been there a few times and the seekh kababs and chicken tikka have always been excellent the food takes a while to come out but then it is fresh food fresh food takes time the service is good went there with kids once not realizing that they have belly dancing - that was embarrassing take out food has been disappointing as well now we always dine-in avoid weekends and make sure we have plenty of time to wait for enjoy the good food this place is a rare find in the heart of scottsdale if you love delicious indian great service lively ambiance then youll fall in love with td just as i have! my favorite dishes are the chicken tikka marsala lamb vindaloo paneer makhani and their garlic naan (the best naan ive ever tasted) if you enjoy super spicy make sure you request the chefs spicy! you may be disappointed if you dont request extra spicy every friday and saturday the exotic spicy cuisine is paired with its spicy exotic belly dancers i highly recommend checking this hidden gem out amy our server was very attentive and pleasantshe was wearing this pretty blouse and i asked about itand she told me the owners mother sells them on fridays (?)def going to check that out next time i really hope they have itty bitty sizes for mefood:nan was overcooked the bottom side was burntchicken tikka masala: seasoning texture and consistency of the dish was excellent chicken was just a tad try but overall great flavorwould be more awesome if they sliced up the chicken into smaller cubes to give flavor consistencyrecommended esp for ppl who dont like spicy its very umami : )i enjoy the creamy touch this place gives to it shich distinguishes this place from other placesseasoned rice: came out warm cooked just rightsamosas choley: non-spicy dish i eat it with the red sauce (spicy) to add a lili kickthe exterior was fried crispy just right and the mashed potato inside were soft and warm beans were very well seasoned and cooked could tell they put time into itmethi chicken: i tried this dish for the first time and i must admit i like it quite a bitordered spicy have water prepared! (amy was diligent w/ h20)i wish i could go to this place every day if i could afford to! im surprised by the low ratings that tandoori times has received we really enjoy coming here and will often come for family dinners when people come into town we really enjoy the belly dancing the women are talented balancing candles swords etc its something different and its always fun when someone at our table gets up and dances too!we also enjoy the hookah lounge on the patio the patio is a really nice private spot they have tons of different flavors and the staff is always helpful and attentive the free chai is also quite deliciousi love the house salad the dressing is really delicious it is a yogurt based dressing with very delicious spices i really could eat it with a spoon but i keep it classy and refraini also order the vegetable biryani- its perfectly seasoned and absolutely amazing it is delicate a little spicy and really shows perfect restraint we love getting the naan my favorites are:garlic (mmmm so well seasoned)onionaloo (stuffed with potato)chii naan with cilantro and and green chili (just the right amont of kick)andmy husband loves the keema naan (minced lamb)dishes that are notable (so says my family):chicken tikka masalachicken saagtandoori fish (my discerning father in law called it one of the best dishes hes ever had many at the table agreed)also i forget which but a few of the lamb dishes are a hit (sorry not that helpful)tandoori times isnt a cheap indian joint but we dont mind paying for the quality of food and the experience most authentic indian food outside of india!  i know because ive been!   dont let the idea of  exotic food scare you awaytheres something for everyone here even vegetarians and children!  try the paneer (pressed cheese) dishes or samosas choley if you dont like meat  try the chicken or paneer makhani if you dont like the heat!  for medium-spicy dishes the chicken tikka masala is excellent with a side of rice and naan bread!  if you want a bite of something thatll bite you back with a really great flavor try the tandoor fish wrap!  the key to eating reasonably is to go as a group of 2 or more get rice and naan and a couple different items to share with the entire table  you dont have to drink alcohol but theres a full service bar at all 3 of the tandoori times locations and the beer selection is above-average!  this is the original location and offers a great semi-upscale atmosphere and a nice patio complete with hookah!  bellydancers join the fun on friday and saturday nights  decent value if you crave very good quality food an exotic atmosphere and an authentic indian experience  ok the bellydancing isnt exactly authentic but its definitely exciting!  one of my favorite weekend hangoutssolid 5 out of 5! service was bad come if youre not in any rush (im talking over an hour before you get a drink) they also forgot to bring out if appetizers which we were glad of in the end because it may have added another hour onto the waitthe belly dancer gimmick is annoying but i am a joyless swine so it might be your thing i dont like being worked for tips for something i didnt ask for though and im pretty sure belly dancing is not an indian tradition anywayfood i ordered a chicken vindaloo which is supposed to be spicy but was pretty mild - it was really tasty though so no complaints the missus got a chicken tikka masala which she enjoyed too naan was decent they also serve kingfisher which is a fine beer  best tasting indian ive had in phoenix so far i  have to write that i was disappointed  the problem may have been the waiter but our appetizers didnt come until 10 minutes later when we had to remind him that it hadnt arrived (he forgot)  he forgot the channa masala and we were too far into our meal to ask for it again  he didnt ask us how hot we wanted our food so it all came out bland without much spiceif you look at my ratings for indian cuisine i pretty much love all of it  by far the best i have found in the phoenix area is the dhaba in tempe  here the food was fine but given the alternatives i wouldnt go back  the veggies were too mashed together and the chicken tikka masala sauce was too thick and goopy  the lamb biryani was good but since they made it so mild i didnt enjoy it as much as i could havethe atmosphere is cute and more upscale than most indian restaurants and the mall area is attractive and upscale as well came here to meet a friend for lunch and i was very disappointed we ordered biryani rice (not bad but not great either) coconut chicken chicken tikka masala and garlic naan after waiting 20 min we got our food the chicken dishes were lukewarm at best and there was no flavor difference between the 2 dishes i had asked for my masala to be spicy but there was no spice whatsoever! the garlic naan had so much garlic on it that it was like biting straight into raw garlic!!!! we waited another 20 min to get our check since our server was nowhere to be found i finally had to go to the bar to get the check do not come here if you want authentic indian cuisine!!!!!,3.35,20
Flavor of India,as a long-term patron of madisons indian restaurants (taste of india maharani maharaja and campus biryani so far) and as a former waitress at an indian restaurant im confident in saying that flavor of india has some of the best north indian food in the city  its menu is comparable in price and selection to most other indian restaurants in madison  however it has a few things that set it head and shoulders above other locations: decor service and a dinner buffetthe walls are painted in rich hues a welcome pick-me-up on blustery gray days filled with stinging rain and wind  even the ceiling is decorated in beautiful tapestries preventing any grating effects of overhead lighting while still allowing for the space to be bright and cheerful  the service was excellent: prompt helpful attentive and friendly  they even gave my party complimentary papadam with tamarind sauce and mint and tomato chutneys!  the dinner buffet is a rare find in indian restaurants and at $1295 its quite reasonably priced  it also features a number of dishes not listed on the regular menu and many are vegetarian  theres also a selection of several dessertsfor dinner last night my companion and i chose to order samosas (flaky crust and well-seasoned contents perfectly accented by the mint chutney - $295) onion and black pepper kulcha (stuffed with sauteed onions warm and fluffy - $295) and a shared entree of chicken tikka masala (rich thick medium-spicy sauce in a vibrant orange shade with perfectly-cooked moist chunks of chicken unlike the sometimes-rubbery overdone chicken ive experienced elsewhere - $1295 with complimentary rice par for the course in madison)  for drinks my companion had a mango lassi (sweet and creamy with beautiful presentation heretofore only seen at taste of india) and i enjoyed a taj mahal (22-ounce indian beer)  i had to stop my companion from licking the chicken tikka masala serving bowl  this was more than enough food for two people and we could hardly move after dinner  entrees are easily shared between two people  spice levels are adjusted for midwestern taste buds so be sure to stress a high spiciness level if thats your intent i had an excellent experience at flavor of india last night  the service was fast and polite the samosas tasted homemade the prices were exceedingly reasonable and the food very tasty  i had the chicken tikka masala - some of the best ive had ever  my dining companion had the chicken shahikorma  he was swayed by the cashews in cream sauce  his dish was delicious but we both agreed that mine was better  the nan was perfect  we were so stuffed from the shared samosas our entrees and nan that we had to forgo dessert  i look forward to returning to flavor of india very soon my mom aunt and i go here pretty much every time we head to madison  we try to vary our orders to make our way through the menu but the chicken tikka masala never fails to be amazing  a few weeks ago we did a take-away order and sat at the concert on the square with our dinners i cant wait until next summer to do it again  i also am dying to get up there during the day to try their lunch buffetthe only thing i dont understand is that every time were there were usually one of only a few people in the dining room  madison eaters go here! this place is fantastic! i was a little skeptical at first; i am one who tends to veer away from buffets but oh so delicious came in for a saturday lunch and the place seemed to be full of regulars our waiter sat us asked if we wanted anything other than water and pointed to the back of the restaurant where a buffet is set up against the back wall there was salad dessert chutney raita naan samosas veggie pakoras and about 12 kinds of curry im not entirely sure what i tried i know i got some goat curry channa masala chicken tikka mutter paneer a little of everything really everything was so delicious probably some of the tastiest indian food ive ever had i am craving it right now! $895 buys you a lunch buffet 10% off with student id!(also save room for the mango ice cream mmmmm perfect ending!) went here for a sunday lunch with friends and overall was happy with what they had to offer i always try everything on a buffet (unless i know for sure i wont like it hehe) so i can say that the buffet is kinda small but does have good dishes theyre chicken tikka masala was so so yummy! and of course my favorite sweet dough balls gulab jamun was also good my friends enjoyed the tandoori chicken and vegetables in a yellow curry sauce we also very much liked the naan even more so when they brought out the cheese naan! the one thing all of us detested was the papadam it was made from lentils and although we all had a different taste reaction it it (i thought it was spicy and bad my friend just thought it was gross another was intrigued but didnt much like it either and could taste that it was made of lentils) we all hated itoverall for a quick basic indian lunch go for it! $10 per person :) i approve!,4.6,5
Mezbaan South Indian Restaurant,theres only one thing you need to know about mezbaan - they do cheap as chips (in fact probably cheaper than chips) dosas for lunch or dinner £295 for a dosa as long as your arm that keep you full till past dinner time seriously check out the photo i uploaded of that bad boy what is a dosa pray tell? a lentil and rice flour pancake stuffed full of yummy spiced goodness i love the peppered lamb and the chicken tikka is so flavourful the most popular is the potato one and mushroom is nice tooso for the same price or in fact cheaper than a pre-packaged factory-prepared sandwich from marks & spencers (id wager theyre around £4 right?) you can get a freshly cooked dosa for £299 and on the side of this dosa there is a little side of cococnut raita and a little side of vegetable curry i mean really!theres also a menu of tapas dishes so plenty of options but again just smaller portions the dosa isnt small though and i think the one i ordered was the small with a bigger option being availableif youve never tried a dosa go try one nom and be full the dosas here are still 5 stars but after a recent dinner here i do have to amend my review slightlyid only ever been for lunch before the lunch menu has a much larger dosa menu with at least 6 different vegetarian and 6 different meat dosas these dosas are smaller and by smaller i mean the size of a small baby they have lamb dosa mushroom dosa two types of chicken so good and only £299 for a potato dosa (masala dosa)the dinner menu only has 6 dosas total and the only meat options are chicken or prawn (small prawns at that) they are also bigger and by big i mean the size of your entire body so big equally delicious but i was really disappointed when i asked if i could see the lunch time dosa menu and they said it wasnt available it was a quiet monday night and if they were making chicken tikka dosas i didnt see why a mushroom dosa would be out of the questionthe service was very proper but a little confused the girl who served us seemed very shy and unsure and had to re-check several times and then took quite a while to take our order but it was still nice they were friendly and eager to pleasethe restaurant itself is a bit worn and tired and bizarrely posh looking very fancy like out of the 80s / 90s attempts at being fancy the floor both myself and my dosa-date noticed was beautiful old fashioned marble-esque black and white tiles i do think the decor could do with an upgradebut the worst part was how cold it was it was a cold january night outside and whilst the restaurant was warmer than outside we both had to dine with our jackets on and my toes were as cold as ice cubes by the time i left and our food went cold very quickly it really was far too cold to be comfortable to dine ini will still come here for the dosas and the dosas alone they are wonderful quite authentic and unusual to any other indian restaurant in edinburgh,4.0,2
Tandoori Times 3 Indian Bistro,classy place located at the holiday innthe chicken makhani and chicken tikka masala were exellenti had both dishes at tandoor 1 and 2but this place tops allvery well seasoned thick rich and creamy with tasty herbsmeat was juicy and just rightrice was consistent in texturea gal in braids served us she had a foreign accent and was very awkward by tring to be overly friendlybut im sure she was just trying to be friendly to her patrons loli think she was a n00b but i realized this place opened not too long agoso shes likely still in trainingi asked her for a to go container for my makhani and masalaand she came out with one of those sandwich containershad to send her back to fetch a soup container bc the sauces will leak and make your car smell like indian food for days!!i would say i was impressed with the foodnot quite san jose level but close :)i would def go back again if i drop by hat side of townif it were closer to home and more affordable id eat it every day :d very good friendly service - we had coconut curry prawns chicken korma chicken tikka masala saag with cheese naan and rice with veggies all were good great atmosphere and service very clean for an indian restaurant food was enjoyable chicken tikka a bit dry but still good was not sure about this place at first due to location but definitely glad i went in my husband and i love indian food we have eaten here 3 times now we have a restaurant that we always go to and wanted to see if there was anything better out there so after having driven by here a few times we decided to stop in the same waiter has served us all three times and the service has always been slow even when there are no other diners the food was really really good the first time we went we had the chicken tikka masala and the sauce was incredible extra creamy and thick the next two times we went the food was just ok it seemed as though the sauce had been watered down a little and that was a real shame all in all i would wish there was a little more consistency in flavorville so we could look forward to a delicious meal everytime! been here many times now and this place is delish we always get the chicken tikka masala and then try something new each time we go the friday chef special goat is fantastic as is the lamb curry an the garlic naan is a must! most authentic indian food outside of india!  i know because ive been!   dont let the idea of  exotic food scare you awaytheres something for everyone here even vegetarians and children!  try the paneer (pressed cheese) dishes or samosas choley if you dont like meat  try the chicken or paneer makhani if you dont like the heat!  for medium-spicy dishes the chicken tikka masala is excellent with a side of rice and naan bread!  if you want a bite of something thatll bite you back with a really great flavor try the tandoor fish wrap!  the key to eating reasonably is to go as a group of 2 or more get rice and naan and a couple different items to share with the entire table  you dont have to drink alcohol but theres a full service bar at all 3 of the tandoori times locations and the beer selection is above-average!  this is the newest of the 3 locations and features a large inside area with an amazing patio (complete with firepit and hookah)!  bellydancers join the fun on friday and saturday nights  decent value if you crave very good quality food an exotic atmosphere and an authentic indian experience  ok the bellydancing isnt exactly authentic but its definitely exciting!  one of my favorite weekend hangoutssolid 5 out of 5! chicken tikka was amazing food was really good i wish there were more server but i would recommend this place the best chicken tikka masala! i love their garlic naan and their rice with peas is delicious! prices are a little steep for india but the quality is very good the staff is super nice which is always a pleasure to walk into the restaurant is located on the side of a hotel it is very nice brand new and very comfortable their is actually an individual tv at each booth which would be perfect for bringing kids or a spouse you dont like the tandoori wings appetizer was ok probably wouldnt order it again however the chicken tikka masala was the best i have had i will absolutely return for that i did not like that they charged extra for rice the garlic naan was amazing and went really well with the tikka masala! our waitress was fantastic and there was a busser/water person that kept us comfortable while she was away they also had a really nice patio but it was pretty dark outside this is a pretty good indian restaurant  a the reviews say the garlic naan is a must and i agree the pompadom are light and the chicken tikka masala has just right bite  overall i was quite pleased prices ate average for this type of restaurant i went to tandoori times through word from a friend that the food was amazing i was very hesitant considering i had never tried indian food before we were seated right away and it seemed to be getting busy so it was perfect timing we got a booth against the wall our waitress greeted us right away and informed us that happy hour was about to end at 7 so we got our first drinks in happy hour she was very friendly when we asked about some of the items on the menu she wasnt sure of some the answers so she called man over ( im assuming the manager) and he gave us the whole run down of the menu! let me tell you whatif you have never had indian food before you are missing out! they recommended the chicken tikka masala and garlic naanamazing! i dont know how i have never eaten here before considering i live right down the street it is a little hard to see and hard to get into but we will for sure be coming back here overall great experience and excellent food!,4.181818181818182,11
Copper Kettle-Salads Balti & Taandoori Grill,wow great food  the chicken tikka masala is the best and the saag paneer is awesome too best indo-pak restaurant in the phoenix area and arizona hands down they also have a location in tempe  i am not an expert on indo-pakistani-etc food so you can take my review with a grain of spicethe foodive been here twice so far and would like to think that my delicate taste buds are getting accustomed to the spiciness i have not tried the buffet just the table service the portions are reasonably sized and food comes out quickly the mango lassi is a must if you are a weakling like me for just about any of the dishes if you are truly weak asking for mild might still be too much for you but then you probably shouldve tried arbys instead i tried tandoori chicken tikka the last time i was heresettingevery time i was here the number of guests was pretty low and i had a choice of booth or tables the spacing is reasonable the lights are just right and there are no funky smells coming from the kitchen so i would say the place is exactly what youd expect for the priceserviceattentive and not overwhelming even towards the end of the night when the waiter obviously didnt want to wait any more everything was served swiftly and water refilled just in timeoveralli will definitely come back the mango lassi has my heart i wish the prices were a bit lower but there are no surprises in what you get for your money exotic warm spicey radiantly delicious everything i tasted got better and better says my wife we had the chicken tikka masala the matar paneer pea pulao (basmati rice) and a garlic & cilantro nan the portions were generous we havent had much indian (or pakistani) food before but just the past week we had some while visiting sedona and its very interesting to see the different styles of preparation  the masala at copper kettle was thicker and i dont think the sauce was spiced as much (as the place in sedona) the chicken in the masala on the other hand was spiced beautifully (fairly hot)  there was a buffet available (at dinner) but we opted for fresh preparation and although we waited a little bit for our food it was worth it the staff was very friendly and assisted us with our selection  we look forward to our next visit! this should be  -5starsfood was terrible to put it midly biryani was stale and dry the rice must have been on the heater since morning tasted bad and rice as bone dry and hardpakoda was a joke was not properly fried and tasted of batterjamoon tasted of oil after first bite chicken tikka was sweet the only eatable dish was naan and ginger chicken they charged 115 for buffer wasnt worth even 2 dollars please look else where for good foodfor good biryani try sabri nehri on devon in chicago in short: pretty decent pakistani food good buffet too  service is sometimes not the greatesti used to go here all the time for their lunch buffet after a night of drinking the best cure for a hangover i have found so far  another plus is that its open till pretty late so you can always grab a quick bite  while you are siting down for your food you can watch a selection of never ending indian soaps  they are just like american ones except with less of a plot and more evil twins than you can countthe food is pretty tasty and the portions are not bad for the price  dont expect indian gourmet but more like pakistani home cooking  you can have a thali (main dish with accompaniment of curries) or order separate  i love their chicken tikka masala and the lamb or chicken kurma  their buffet is pretty nice too you can find the typical south asian dishes  i like the food here better than most indian restaurants cause they dont go nuts with the spices  i think in general pakistani food is less spicy than indian foodi do have to note that sometimes the service is sub par but not always  the atmosphere is not the best a bit rundown and weirdly lit but i usually dont give it much head and enjoy their food,3.2,5
Pastries N Chaat,very nice place if you are a pastries fan then i would definitely recommend this place lots of variety of pastries and chaat snacks i have tried pav bhaji  samosa chaat and chicken tikka pizza samosas(both big and irani) and puffs everything was good only concern was samosa could have been betterthe service is kind off slow and we have to request for water all the time,4.0,1
Kohinoor Cuisine of India,groupon scam please read:update 11/9/2013 yelp deleted my photo of the container of chicken tikka masala next to a can of coke the picture shows the size of the container smaller than the size of a coke this was my order my experience so yelp is being an ass to remove my photoon to the review:this place was a total sham we bought the $25 for $12 take out groupon we showed up and asked for a menu (no menu from kohinoor online not even on their facebook scam)  they said they had no menu what? after asking a couple times the owner said to someone else get the menu and cocked his head they managed to come up with a ridiculously priced menu after being there for 10 minutes $1299 for chicken tikka masala with no rice or naan the biltmore doesnt even charge these priceswe are a regular of curry corner literally a stones throw away and the owner starts talking crap about curry corner at cc you get the tikka masala rice and add garlic naan for $10 anyway you dont eat chicken tikka masala without rice or naan (and no other restaurant we have ever been to hasnt offered it) so my husband ordered this for me (it came to $20 here!!!!!) and his lamb biryani ($1299) when the food comes and the owner shows my husband the food my husband is shocked shocked he is charging $1299 for what cc charges $8 then the owner tells my husband that cc sells a smaller size that my husband could go to cc right now if he didnt believe him what!!!! we eat there once a week! i get the same thing @ cc and we would know what size they give us!my husband is arab and is talking to the owner who is totally swindling my husband he gives my husband a small mango yogurt drink and then he goes on to tell us that if we stop going to cc and go to his restaurant that he would sell us the buffet for $899 and our kids would eat free (they are 26 months and 9 months)  then he takes my husband next door to the store to show him the halal meat (is this when they put the buffet food in the take out containers or take the buffet food to the back and make chicken tikka masala and biryani out of the buffet spread? no proof but i wouldnt doubt this)so my husband said ok he paid for our food difference $8 and leftwhen we got home his biryani was beef not lamb there was no mix up we were the only ones in the restaurant and my husband was talking to the owner the entire timethis was a horrible groupon experience and a total scam offering a take out groupon for $12 for $25 worth of food and then offering ridiculous prices and claiming they dont have a menuby the way they have a lunch buffet for $699 and dinner for $999 with ctm samosas rice naan etc so prey tell me how they are selling chicken tikka masala to go for $1299 with no rice or naan?my husband threw out his biryani the beef was inedible (chewy and old the dish was room temperature) and then he ended up eating leftover bbq pulled chicken sandwich that i made yesterday i took pictures of my ctm and the container is smaller than the size of a can of coke ctm was room temperature (it should have been hot) edible not good but not bad  but i wouldnt go back if it was even $5in the real world we pretty much got $10 worth of food (inedible beef biryani) and we paid $20 im reviewing the buffet not the menu its a buffet i recommend especially if you look for their groupon great selection for a lunch buffet and everything is delicious my personal favorite is the chicken tikka masala but thats my favorite indian dish anywhere the garlic naan is top notch as well in all its fantastic value for the buffet service is friendly too it is a mom and pop shop so the owners handle everythingi gave it four stars instead of five because of my own taste preferences everything seemed to be too spicey for my liking and nothing is labeled spicy so it can be a surprise also to be entirely honest i have had better-tasting indian cuisine but i will admit it was almost twice as much in cost and they do not have kohnoors selection the atmosphere is also a bit dimly lit for a restaurant but most other indian restaurants ive been to are also dimly lit so this could be a cultural thing in all it did not wow me inside but it is very clean and nothing looks old so it is a place you could bring someone though it is a shame there is so much construction outside and the neighborhood around doesnt look nice as a resultin summary all my negatives are purely subjective i will be coming back here and i recommend you try it too used a livingsocial coupon on the weekend for their lunch buffet  greeted when we walked thru the door and were offered any seat in the house  they had my husbands favorite chana masala along with spinach cheese tandoori chicken tikka masala curry chicken butter chicken & 2 types of rice and some desserts  a fragrant spicy flavor to each  i didnt care for the dahl; the lentils tasted burnt  the eggplant dish tasted sour  the pakoras were all potatoes  the chicken dishes fell off the bone  the naan was slightly too but still good  our server hovered way too much and it became a little annoying by the end of the meal  he insisted that we had to buy a drink with the meal at which point we carefully read the coupon  he got nervous and said it was ok not to purchase a drink  we didnt like the pressure  he also kept mentioned that the place was open everyday including a nice mothers day buffet   despite that we will go again for the tasty food and just know that this guy will bug us after having been to a few different indian restaurants in the valley id say that this one is one of the better ones! their buffet offers a quite a few vegetarian options including curries & samosas; they have 4 or 5 different kinds of chicken options - chicken curry chicken tikka masala karahi chicken etc along with egg curry the best part is that with the buffet you can also get naan a plate of chaat & mango lassi the food is a little bit on the spicy side but its really tasty as with pretty much all buffets the desserts arent that great a little bit surprising considering that they sell them in bulk the highlights are definitely the mango lassi naan chicken tikka masala & chaat! i will go back for those every time!,3.25,4
India Gate,i was on a date with my daughter dammit  heres how it works:  every other wednesday each of us takes a daughter out to dinner  that way we get to have dinner with each of our daughters once a month  its a great opportunity to check in -- hopefully they will open up at some point  anyway this time my oldest picked indian  i was thrilled  usually they both pick chinese and much as i like it it does get tiresomemeanwhile back at the review we ordered the meat appetizer  this had a couple kinds of chicken a meat samosa and lamb kabob  it was fine not bad not brilliant  my daughter got chicken tikka masala her favorite  i tried a ginger kabob at the waiters suggestion  these too were fine  no fine dining but not bad  at this point i didnt realize that they nickel and dime you so i was still oblivious as to what this mediocre food was going to cost methen we went to the bathroom  we were nearly done and my daughter asked me to accompany her  thats where we saw it -- the cockroach  it was easily an inch long before you got to the antenna  to be fair it was dead  but at some point it had been alive and had had plenty of time to grow oddly large  now i realize that im new to phx and there are palmetto bugs here but i used to live in an old brownstone in the city and i know a cockroach when i see it  it was right under the empty toilet paper dispenseri told the waiter that the toilet paper dispenser was empty hoping that hed see the roach and know that i saw it  i paid the bill and left intent on warning yelpers everywhere this place is good for a quick scoff and run the food is pretty decent (the chicken tikka masala has never let me down here) although their onion bhajis need some work and the service is usually prompt and efficient dont come for atmosphere though talk about over lit! its like eating under the spotlights of an evening sports event i went here for dinner and only got the buffet because i couldnt decide what to order off the menu i really enjoyed the chicken tikka masala i like mildly spicy food and this was perfect the rest of the food was kind of bland the dinner buffet was $1099; i think that is reasonably priced but it was the first indian buffet ive ever had so i cant compare the service was outstanding to sum up the food experience i have to say that ive had better  i went to try out their lunch buffet  the restaurant was clean as it was still showing the grand opening sign out front  the buffet options was not very impressive  they had veg pakora (cold) and no samosas  their meat options were chicken tikka masala which was very dissapointing  it was a tomato base with absolutely no spices  it could have used some garam masala and some ginger and other indian spices  it tasted like tikka masala out of a jar  it just did not give you a sense of any effort was made  the tandoori chicken was also bland with absolutely no flavor  again where is the indian spices?  the vegetable dishes were saag paneer and dahl fry which were both ok but no aloo gobi??  i have to admit the basmati rice and garlic naan were the best thing there  another big disappointment was the gulab jamun dessert which was ice cold  i prefer the honey syrup to be warmas if it was frozen and just defrosted   basically nothing other than the rice and bread tasted home made  i will definitely not be back! wow just had some great indian food i had the dinner plate which was an amazing three course meal which included mughlai soup followed up by chicken tikka masala chicken makhni and basmati rice the flavors were amazing and all of the ingredients tasted very fresh for desert we had kheera type of rice pudding which acted as a great balance after the spice overall a great find i cant wait to eat there again no surprises here at this simple buffet for $799 you can pig out on various vegetable dishes chicken entrees salad and sweets like gulab jamun and carrot halwathe buffet was pretty basic they had your standard dishes youd see at an indian buffet such as vegetable korma chicken tikka masala a saag (spinach) dish and some dark meat tandoori chicken they also had a tray of chicken vindaloo a bright red dish with spicy heat! unfortunately the dishes were lacking in that certain punch that makes indian food when done right so remarkable the vegetable korma was a little runny in consistency and seemed to consist mainly of potatoes and not much else same could be said for the vindaloo i couldnt really find any pieces of chicken in it just potato the chicken tikka masala was ok but nothing really too impressive there was also a tray of veggie pakora and basmati rice i enjoyed the veggie pakora the most out of all the savory dishes there were a lot of veggies packed into the fritter fried until tender with a tasty batter i also enjoyed the fresh garlic naan brought to the table there was also a salad area condiments such as raita and chutney and some dessert out of the two desserts (carrot halwa and gulab jamun) i liked the gulab jamun the most it had that nice tender cake-like texture that the dish typically has soaked in some sweet syrupsoda fountain drinks are $199 and consist of coke productsthe buffet for lunch is from monday through friday the saving grace of the meal was the price point since it was just $799 i wasnt too disappointed that my meal consisted of mainly potatoes in various curries rather than a multitude of various meats and veggies,2.8333333333333335,6
Aromas at Island Restaurant,alexis and i have been looking for a replacement for jewel of the crown of old   after many years we have found one  no - we havent found its replacement we found one that is better; much better!  here is how the food goes:the naan (traditional and garlic) is great!aloo tikki is the best that i have had anywhere!i am not normally a fan of the paneer but even i thought it was goodchicken tikka masala was great!  normally i am a fan of a much creamer version but i have been converted  this was so good we got an order to go for the next daylastly their chicken tikka reminds me of just how good this dish is supposed to be!we also ordered a side of rice and some ice teas and they also were goodthey make everything from scratch so be prepared to spend 20-30 minutes waiting on the food  iced tea costs $1 per glass so no free refills  a much better deal than spending $275 at other placesthis old adage of the hole in the wall family restaurants are the best! holds true   in our opinion this place is one of the best restaurants and absolutely the best when it comes to pakistani/indian cuisine!,5.0,1
India Grill,we went for the lunch buffet & came back to work stuffed & happy it was spicy full of flavor & delicious next time im trying the chicken tikka i tried india grill today  i ordered lamb karahi chicken tikka masala and lamb biryanithe chicken tikka masala was good  not great but a solid goodthe lamb karahi was nice  pleasantly spicy with other flavors making themselves knownthe lamb biryani was sub par  i have had much better  i have also had lamb biryani that was worse (that place is out of business)all in all an ok experience  i give it two stars for being more expensive than my usual indian restaurant (india palace) when we moved from ca a few years ago we tried in vain to find an indian restaurant in the valley that could deliver the amazing tasting indian food we enjoyed in ca  then we tried indias grill (their former name at their former location in mesa) and rejoiced  hands down best indian food weve found in the valleywe were sad when they closed the mesa location but recently learned they reopened at india grill in tempe  since then weve been back half a dozen times  the chicken tikka and chicken tikka masala are incredible!!!  and the naan bread is great  they even have flying horse beer which is not easy to come bythe new location is even a little nicer than the previous one although neither are convenient to us  its still way worth the drive!!fyi we never do the buffet  not our thing  we always order off the menu so this place shouldnt be tagged a buffet only place,4.0,3
Copper Kettle,copper kettle in tempe is now copper kettle in chandler  i had never been to the previous restaurant but the new location opened up very recently (either this tuesday or last tuesday)  they offer a dinner buffet for $11 soda is $150  there are a good selection of meat dishes vegetable dishes and some desserts  naan is served freshly baked at your table  although there is a wide selection of meat and vegetable dishes to choose from not all of the dishes are labeled so you are left with trying out brown colored curry with mystery meat or light cream colored mystery blob  despite the variety the dishes themselves were a bit hit and miss  i wasnt a big fan of the pakora curry (or light cream colored mystery blob to some) it was a bit too sour tasting  the chicken tikka masala was decent and dessert was pretty good (gulab jamun rice pudding fruit custard) not extremely sweet like some desserts at indian restaurants can be  the naan was decent not the best ive had but it came in a large basket and there was plenty of it to go around  generally i like that they offer dinner buffet here since most indian restaurants offer lunch buffet only and just entrees for dinner  i think india oven in mesa does a better job at their buffet in terms of quality of the dishes but this restaurant will do if im in the area wanting a cartload of indian food! our new favorite place!  the waitress was so helpful picking out foods we wanted to eat and my 7-yr old even found something he likedi cant remember the names of the foods they got but we asked her if the lamb was real or some sort of steak-lamb or spam-lamb she said it was real but it seems and tastes more real in 2 particular dishes (one of which my hubby tried) apparently the shish-kebob lamb is real but may taste pressed or look unreal or something which must be common in various restaurants because this is the first place hes found what seemed to be real lamb meatthe chicken tikka tandoori was wonderful and a huge portion--all 3 of us ate from my plate the naan at first tasted different but when it cooled down it was really really good (and huge)  the samosas were medium-sized; i have not been able to find those very small ones that they sell in other countries; guess i wont find them here in americaeven the soft drinks tasted well-blended (often a problem in restaurants)they took our entertainment coupon gladly i didnt see any baby seats and so we had to prop the car seat on a chair for our sleeping babyfyi we went during the week and saw no dinner buffet (maybe there was one? not sure) but she said it was packed on the weekends so maybe its only a buffet on the weekends let me start off by saying i am not new to the copper kettle a friend introduced me to this place about a year ago had been going to the on dobson and guadalupe i told my son since it was just him and i (he has 3 sisters so its rare when its just him and i) we should go out to dinner and i asked him if he is willing to try something different he was game but also my son likes to try new things out and will even eat dishes i will notso i took him to copper kettle when we walked in we liked what we saw what a nice set up this new place is we were the only on there but to be honest we were in the parking lot before 5 hahaso i ordered a basket of onion stuffed naan bread if you havent tried it you should its naan bread with sauté onions stuffed in the center of it! so dang delish!my son ordered lamb karahi which was lamb cooked with onions tomatoes yoghurt ginger garlic paste he loved it!  i didnt try it like i said he will eat dishes that i am not brave enough to do and im not sure about lamb yet loli ordered my fav dish! chicken tikka masala!! omg tender tandoori grilled chicken that then simmers in this beautiful orange/red masala sauce that just sends your taste buds into this heavenly bliss!! just cant get enough! i have left overs for lunch that im already wanting lolalso ordered pea pulao which is rice brown onions and peas with seasonings i love it!  i am not a big rice eater but i love this dish!! have to say i am happy the copper kettle moved closer to my house now i can fill up on food and walk it off when walking home lol  i will be back! ive ordered take out from this place 4 times and ive loved everything ive tried  chicken tikka masala is my favorite but i try to order other things as well  the vegetarian balti is really good as well as the channa masala  this place is great im so glad its around the corner from my place  cant wait to get a sitter sometime so my old man and i can try the buffet went on a saturday night using our entertainment coupon (which listed old address had to call for new they gave a nice apology) there was a party going on behind screens all pakistanis women & girls in traditional wear balloons lots of children that were literally running though the restaurant squealing with delight very glad we were not expecting a romantic dinner we approached it as cultural diversity chose to enjoy the loud festive atmosphere ok a little annoyed when one of the little girls did a few particularly high-pitched repeated squeals & one kid bumped my chair as they chased each other across the restaurantit was less than an hour of closing so we asked if the buffet was not such a good idea (been out a while no fresh coming) the kid waiter went to ask and we appreciate that he returned reporting that the menu would be a better choice to insure quality ordered lentil soup & sesame naan (new & listed on back pages) lentil soup was soft yellow color not darker lentils im used to it was creamy with very small pieces of lentils the flavor was more mild than im used to but a subtle spicy it was nice no complaints the sesame naan was fresh crisp bottom soft top layer added a bit of salt and wow delicious!! lots of sesames on top yumthen ordered chicken tikka masala as im working my husband into such foods and he for sure likes this dish nice white breast meat which he prefers simmered in that divine red creamy sauce id call it mild heat at best id prefer a bit spicier but perfect for my husband we brought our beverage with us after calling to make sure it was okay nothing is mentioned on the website one way or the other they were very accommodating for this brought us glasses and offered an opener to use i am under the impression theres a seating size limit to such places & not sure they dont exceed it so im going to stay vague so they/we dont lose this option! it was great - kept our bill nice and lowif it wasnt for the entertainment coupon we wouldnt have known to try them now we will be back!4 stars not five because it was really good but not mind-blowing it would take a big wow to have me give 5 children thing doesnt affect score as i know that was a celebration exception and again chose to see it as a cultural experience omar works part-time very nice friendly good customer service he apologized for the chaotic environment which was nice saw grumpy uncle at counter no smile but we didnt have any interaction with him we were waited on mainly by a nice kid with puffy black hair seemed a bit timid but did fine with everything omar came to us and chatted at the end of the evening was not very impressed with my experience here saturday night came in for their weekend dinner buffet selection was okay and one could tell that some of the recipes were unique and traditional just didnt get the impression that much care/attention was given to the quality or presentation of the buffet  beef kabobs had some flavor but were a bit dry chicken tikka and chile chicken were tasty good cauliflower dish beef meatballs were bland and as many have said - the naan is more like a sauteed fluffy pita bread no goat or lamb (bummer!)  i got my fill and may try it again sometime - but will continue looking for my go-to spot in chandler/gilbert the chicken tikka masala was awesome! :) this place was empty when we walked in- it felt a little awkward the food was good but there was only one guy who was doing the waiting he refilled our drinks and then brought out our food thats it the food was awesome though i order take put from here and the food is great  the chicken tikka masala is delicious  i love the channa masala samosa and garlic naan are awesome  it has been pretty slow when i pick up my food (which i dont understand since the food is excellent)  i had the okra balti today and it was a hit with my family  check the place out,4.125,8
New India Bazaar,i have driven by this place for years and never would have stopped here if my friend salavador hadnt offered me a taste of his chicken tikka masala one day  the ambiance isnt much to speak of--you eat at some tables at one side of a grocery store or you can take your food to go--but when the food is this good who cares?!  the prices are incredibly cheap and you get rice and naan with every meal  i took reviewer trudeaus suggestion and added a chaat to my meal and i didnt regret it  super yummy  i also got chicken saag and aloo gobi both of which were excellent  the only thing i would change for my next order is to ask for the food to be mild  i should have taken the other reviewers comments about the spiciness of the food to heart  medium here is hot elsewhere in town  my nose was runny for about an hour after finishing dinner because it was just too spicy for me  as a bonus you can shop in the grocery for all kinds of exotic (at least to me) items while you wait for your food  i will definitely be returning here in the future  its my new go-to for indian food in downtown phoenix this place is great!  so happy to have a solid grocery store and chaat place in central phoenix  good chaat mithai (sweets) and other delights  usually fresh jalebis too :)  for diwali they had really nice milk sweet mithais that tasted homemade to me  the thalis are great; especially the chicken tikka one   i havent tried the pizza but it sounds good  the vegetarian thali/meal selection is decent but not quite as good as little india  the grocery store is small but they have the necessities: spices dhals rice attas frozen foods namkeens indian beauty supplies etc  the folks who work here are nice and helpful in finding grocery items  best part: when i was there today i saw some buffet equipment and when i inquired i was told they are going to open a full restaurant in the back!  woo hoo cant wait!!! i have been to over 30 indian restaurants on three continents  who would have guessed my new favorite would be attached to an indian grocery store in downtown phoenix  if you dont like their chicken tikka masala i dont think we can be friends we just see the world too differently  amazing! had a great dinner with my family the food was simply wonderful with no pretense in the surroundings the butter chicken was wonderful with a warm spice and sweet curry flavors wrapped around the creamy tomato sauce  my other half had the lamb koorma and was tender and covered in a rich sweet sauce whose aroma made my tummy rumble for a bite  our son had the chicken tikka wrap and it was huge for 599 he loved all the goodies inside  the nahn was wonderfully tender and garlicky   the service was great our server was friendly and easy to talk to we will defiantly be back to explore more flavors hidden in the bazaar 35 stars would be more accurate as others have mentioned this place is attached to a small store (goat on sale right now for $399not bad) and that makes the vibe a little odd no big deal though i liked the place fine especially considering how close it is to workspoiled now by all of those new indian places ive been reviewing over the past few weeks i thought the food here was decent but not great i like that they had samosa on the buffet ive not seen that lately the chicken tikka masala was good if more mild than i am used to nothing was bad everything was good nothing was super outstanding a great lunch place for $799 dinner prices are low too ill try that some time and report back service was basicthey bring you a drink and you pay at the register so i dont have much to say about that good or bad not friendly but not unfriendly either it is a store with a restaurant in it bottom line the lunch buffet is a good value at $799  there was a standard selection of typical dishes from tasty samosas to tandoori chicken and chicken tikka  i appreciated that some of the dishes had a little kick and werent dumbed-down to cater toward an uncultured american palate  the buffet also came with some very plain but fresh and warm naanthe service was average and the decor is very basic  a small indian grocery store is also located within the building try the samosa  these are really good!  we got the chicken tikka and lamb korma meals both were fantastic  definitely a great place that wont disappoint the food was pretty good! chicken tikka & naan are my favorite things in the world :) i paid $27 for an order of garlic naan regular naan butter chicken & chicken tikka with a soda lunch buffet is only about $8 so i suggest going around that time service was decent but only because the food came pretty quickly we were not greeted at the end the server said was it okay after we paid we got no have a good night even after i told her to enjoy her weekend! lol whatever the food was good but i hope to find a better indian restaurant in the phoenix area because of the service indian buffet for $799how can you go wrong?this small restaurant is tucked away in a well stocked indian market on 7th ave south of virginia avenue  the buffet is small and the food is well prepared and tasty   most of the main dishes have been the same the few times we have been here but on the other hand you can count on your favorites being there next time you go and being sure that you can get your fixthe chicken tikka marsala is my favorite along with the vegetable pakoras and of course the freshly cooked naan brought to your table  i have never been a fan of samosas however my vegetarian friend tells me they are the best around my only complaint would be that the gulab jamun are not served warmif you are looking for a classy indian restaurant to bring a date this is not it  it is simple place with the most basic of tables and decorif you are looking for a good indian food at a very good price then you need to try this hideaway,4.0,9
Kabab Palace,i had just had indian food the night before that made me slightly ill but deicded to eat here and was so glad i did! the food was reasonable and the service fairly good the portions were just right-the chicken tikka masala is a must-have! by far my favorite indian restaurant in phoenix so far  (and believe me ive tried quite a few)  i have had the lunch buffet here and dinner entrees  the lunch buffet had a good variety and everything was tasty  typical indian buffet but done well  for dinner i first had to try my standard chicken tikka masala which was creamy with good flavor  the tandoori chicken was very tender  naan was good as well  nothing special about the inside of the restaurant  it just made the top of my list because i like the food the most this place does not deserve a 4-5 star  the food is average and the price is super expensive  the biriyani is not good  and the chicken tikka is only colorful  taste is now ever like the traditional tikka i was craving for indian good very badly and kabab place is actually not too far from my place i ordered chicken tikka masala and samosa  for pick up and omg  chicken tikka masala was great and chicken was tender  and samosa was nice and fresh  great food all together,3.5,4
Bay Leaf Cafe,the food at this restaurant was a bit below average  i ordered vegetable samosas chicken tikka masala and garlic naan  the samosas were a bit overdoneboderline burnt  the chicken tikka masala was a bit bland with very little taste  the naan was pretty good  the staff provided good service  i might give this restaurant another chance a nice quaint little local place  the food is very authentic although the menu is quite limited compared to most indian restaurants ive been to  of the dishes weve tried we like the chicken tikka massala the best  the lamb curry is pretty good too  its not on the menu but the chef made me some lamb vindaloo and it was great  their garlic naan is ok but inconsistent i have been here twice once when it first opened at the average cost of $1400 a head we ate off the cardboard plates and were put off although the food wasnt bad but not at all spicy i thought i would give it a second try this time i did a takeout - i ordered two chicken tikka masalas medium spice  and a tandoori chicken for a friend who does not like curry - rice came with all three dishes and we ordered naan breads too the masala have 10 small chucks of chicken in them in a pale yellow fairly bland sauce and the tandoori chicken which should be dry was served with peppers and onion fry with a chili paste which they then coated the chicken with! most of it got thrown away i did return one masala which they gave me store credit for ($1095) with two explanations - one each chef has a variation on how they cook the dishes (our chef had decided that tomatoes shouldnt be a part of our tomato based curry)  two for our american customers we tell them not too cook it spicy! sorry bay leaf owners but in my opinion consistency is an important part of running a restaurant stopped in on a sunday around 1:15 to get a meal to-go there was not a single person in the place we ordered the vegetable pakoras tandoori chicken and chicken tikka masala to go we waited ~45 minutes for the food which felt excessive  no one in the restaurant and that kind of a wait for two meals and an appetizer? really?the story doesnt end there we got the food back and started eating a red bell pepper garnish with the pakoras tasted off and then we came across a green bell pepper with mold on it how can the rest of the meal be trusted at that point? this place missed the mark today and we will not be going back be wary of the food quality should you decide to go i placed a to-go order and was given a 35 minute wait time  when we arrived to pick up the food it was not ready yet so we had to wait around bringing the total time closer to 45 minutesthe food was really delicious  we had chicken tikka masala alu gobi and paneer tikka masala the alu gobi was great and well-spiced  i realized that we were never asked for a spice level like at some restaurants and i think i like having the food prepared the way the chef intends  that might be disagreeable to you if you dont enjoy spicy foods  the naan was great as it usually is  the rice came with our meals although the amount was a less than what is usually provided with an entree  i think they might have been trying to avoid making another batch since it was kind of lateso in recap the food (most importantly) was very good  the only complaint would be that the amount of rice was a little skimpy and the extra wait time  these things are pretty minor to me for the convenience and good food  i would order from bay leaf cafe again and i probably will oh my goodness! this is a hidden gem! we ordered takeout 1: vegetable samosas: 2 per order came with mint and tamarind chutneys delicious crispy tender great seasoning2: chole bhature: my personal fav is always chole and this is excellent came with 2 (not one!) bhature to scoop up all the delicious juiciness3: bay leaf chicken tikka: my husband said that this was the best chicken dish he had eaten all year! (and hes a very particular/picky eater!)4:palak paneer: beautiful emerald green goodness with just enough paneer 5: naan: perfect!6: basmati rice: fragrant fluffy7: mango lassi: sweet tart ice cold so much food we have enough left for either another dinner or 3-4 lunches (if i can stay out of the fridge tonight!) everything was perfect spice nothing mouth-numbingstaff was very friendly takeout was very carefully packed we will definitely be back soon!!! the food was absolutely terrible we had a groupon so got stuck with ordering more than one dish the cook and the janitor were doubling as the the waiter the cook came out with his apron to take our order that should have a sign to run to the exit but we stayed since this was out first time there we ordered the bay leaf tikka the mutton biryani and the chicken tikka masala all were terrible the rice was under cooked and it looked like they had sprinkled on some of the spices right at the end the other dishes were over spiced with heingh which made it uneatable we  have tried several places around the valley and this is at the bottom of the pile sad to see all the effort to make the place look nice but the food is less than desirable :-( our first and last visit the food here is pretty good  smaller portions than your traditional indian restaurant but then again it is a cafe  its a family owned restaurant with them owning the yogurt shop and salon adjacent to them  i prefer spicier food and have found that you have to make it clear you want indian spicy hot or they wont make it so the naan is awesome; garlic all the way  i usually do the chicken tikka masala with the naan  they offer discounts for intel and other companies in the area  however if you do the yelp deal you cant combine them food is very tastey but not intensely seasoned just right for my wife they dont have the expected indian lunch buffet instead their rice bowl is one of the best deals around 6 generous portions of entrees with the rice the  chicken tikka masala is our favorite the dining area is pleasing and the service is always cheerful and accomidating one of my chandler favorites had been craving indian food for a couple weeks this place did ok with fulfilling my fix what i enjoyed was the friendly service its a sunday evening and hubby and i found the $10 for $15 deal on yelp and decided to give it a try we were the only ones in the place so the young lady was able to give us her undivided attention she explained the dishes i was curious about and actually offered up a couple samples i absolutely loved the chicken sheesh kabob that she highly recommended i asked for spicy and it was! its minced chicken w green chili and indian spices rolled into a shape of a sausage not on a stick we also tried the chicken boti and the chicken tikka marsala (we like chicken) those were good just not as spicy as i like it to be we plan to return to try the lunch buffet we decided to go back to this restaurant for lunch this time we both ordered the lunch bowl the service was really fast and the food was really good the rice bowl came with paneer masala chicken curry chicken tikka masala okra garbanzo beans & some cauliflower and potato the paneer & chicken tikka were my favorites but the rest of the choices were good as well the cost for the plate was $655 with tax definitely worth it! ill definitely come back for it love this place the chicken tikka masala is really good and the rice bowl is such a good deal in a sea of taco shops the bay leaf cafe is like a lighthouse of dining adventure this was my first visit to an indian restaurant and i loved it our server jobi was friendly and helpful and navigated our way through uncharted waters the vegetable samosas a pastry wrapped appetizer was flakey and delicious chicken tikka masala is outstanding be sure to order naan bread right from the oven to dip up every bit of the rich tomato gravy our meal at the bay leaf cafe was a culinary adventure and a dining success! look forward to our next visit,3.4615384615384617,13
Saffron,its never a good sign when you drive up to a business and the parking lot is empty to be fair it was 5:30 pm on super bowl sunday but still this is an indian/pakistani restaurant so youd think the typical crowd might be more world cup and less big gameits an even worse sign when you see vinyl lettering on the window of an indian restaurant that reads salon de fiestas and sure enough walking into saffron for the first time it doesnt feel at all like a cozy indian restaurant it feels like a banquet room only two booths the rest of the expansive room filled with round-top banquet tables chairs covered in plastic a little stage in the corner and completely emptyan indian restaurant should smell like i dunno indian food when you walk in this place didnt it smelled like  an old folks home or something something not right and it was dead quiet in there not even a tv or radio onthere was one person visibly working in the entire place a middle-aged woman who was helpful enough but not very friendly you think shed be thrilled to see even one person let alone a couple walk in not so she kind of just gestured toward whatever table we wanted dropped off menus and disappeared didnt ask us for drinks or anythingthe menu was typical indian fare and prices were about average we ordered some of our favorites -- veggie samosas pakora chicken tikka masala aloo gobi as well as some rice and two kinds of naan at the same time the host/server/whatever finally took our drink orders sadly this joint doesnt serve alcohol i hate it when i cant order a good indian beer with my mealit took a long time to get even our drinks (water and iced tea) out which came with the appetizers the samosas were ok the pakora was weird im used to pakora being similar to tempeh -- just vegetables dipped in batter and fried these were more like spongy batter balls with diced veggies inside maybe theyre more authentic i dont know but they suckedthe entrees were solid nothing to write home (or um on yelp) about kind of weak-flavored but decent the naan was good enough we had a restaurantcom gift certificate to use and when the lady first looked at it she said thats not us she said this because their logo didnt print and she thought the missing image graphic was someone elses logo i had to point out to her the name and address and phone of her own business she did eventually take the discount off our billinterestingly at some point a man and his child walked in during our meal heartily greeted us and i assume he is the owner or manager at least which leads me to believe our host/server might have been his wife maybe she was grumpy that she had to work by herself while he was watching the big game or something had he been there when we first arrived we might have felt better but either way were never going back here which is a shame because it is literally walking distance from our house theres another review here which describes saffrons interior as being more like a banquet hall than an indian restaurant and i have to concur completely when we arrived at around 8pm on a saturday the large rectangular building was empty with the exception of two other pairs of customers at the round tables in the main part of the room down one side there are four half-booths although only two of these appear to be available for customers with one having a computer set up upon it and the other outfitted with a pair of mismatched padded office chairs appears to be used as a hangout for the proprietors children when they arent helping out with the restaurantafter being instructed by a small child to just sit anywhere we took one of the open booths and another child brought us our menus the covers looked slightly grubby like they could have used a wipe down and i noticed a large stain on the side of the booth next door to ours - it looked like someone had spilled a large glass of coke over the side of the table at one point and that it had been allowed to set before washing chairs and tables were covered with plastic to ward off such spillages and the plastic on top of our table felt like it could have been a little cleaner also as could the salt and pepper shakers which felt a little grimy when we moved themthe restaurant is a bit odd and has a little raised section in the corner opposite the door and the 1970s disco ball in the middle of the room the disco ball was just a mystery and i expected to see the four children from the chronicles of narnia file in and take their places in the four throne-like armchairs upon the curious dais at any moment it was an unusual atmosphereafter a few minutes our host arrived with a jug of room temperature water with shrink wrap covering the top he had collected this from one of the central tables which was home to a collection of such jugs he seemed very friendly however and quickly accepted our restaurantcom certificate and enthusiastically took our order in order to meet the $35 requirement we ordered chicken tikka masala malai kofta shahi paneer and a selection of naan (two garlic one sesame)our host then presented us with some pappadums and the usual chutneys of tamarind and mint the mint chutney had a nice kick to it and although the tamarind had an uncharacteristically odd ketchupy taste it mellowed into a pleasant aftertaste so it all worked out we were cheerfully informed that we could ask for more pappadums if we liked and as the host departed i commented to my wife about how the friendliness and enthusiasm was enough to make me overlook some of the oddities of the place in my upcoming yelp reviewdespite the fact that there were very few others in the restaurant we didnt see any staff again for the forty or so minutes it took for our food to arrive i wasnt bothered at all by the longer than average wait time and the food more than made up for it anyway my chicken tikka masala was a little milder than i am used to however the very nutty and savoury shahi paneer was a perfect accompaniment i found my garlic naan to be tasty without being amazing but my wife found her sesame naan to be a little overcooked on the bottom the malai kofta was somewhat different to other incarnations of this dish that ive experienced the sauce tasted more like a onion/butter sauce than creamy but was tasty however the kofta themselves were dark somewhat sharp in flavour and fell to pieces at the merest touch of an eating utensil overall though the food was excellent and we couldnt wait to return and i expected to award the restaurant four stars with a disclaimer about the slightly odd vibe to the place and maybe a friendly suggestion that they wipe up a bit in my reviewthis is where things took a turn for the worse a medium sized party had entered the restaurant and placed their orders just as i was enjoying the last bites of sauce-dipped naan and they also appeared to have a couple of take-out customers our host asked me how everything was to our enthusiastic responses and disappeared into the kitcheni got my credit card out and politely sat at the table waiting to deal with my bill twenty minutes later we were still waiting ten minutes later i asked a child if they could ask someone to help us with our bill twenty minutes passed and a surly woman came out but it was to deal with a takeout customer the child still clutched our bill and restaurantcom certificate finally after about an hour of waiting we were finally dealt with and could get out of there lamenting that we could have driven across town to our home twice in the time we waited to pay for our mealthe food here is great but being made to wait a full hour (no exaggeration) to pay including 30 minutes after you tell them you want to pay is just unacceptable especially when there were at least three adult staff members and custom was slow we came here for my moms birthday dinner using a groupon deal this place is by far the worst restaurant ive been to in my life for sure the worst indian restaurant ive encountered the service was crazy slow to the point that it was nonexistentliterally everyone was serving themselves water my family and i waited for 50 minutes before we got cups for water even then we had to ask for it ourselves other tables had strawswe never got them we never got refills either our appetizer was a frozen samosa that they fried up in 30 seconds ackkk all their dishes were beyond horrible i always order chicken tikka masala ive tasted it at many locations and here it tasted just like tomato sauce straight from the can such a let down the other dishes we ordered were also not swallowable normally if we dont finish our food we take it to-go not this food it wasnt worth packing up for later if we couldnt even handle it fresh they also never brought out a meal that we had ordered yet we had already paid for it through groupon when we asked about it we were given attitude and told well see if we have time to bring out your dish we were not brought our bill and left in the end after asking and waiting for it for 20 minutes such a huge let down the service and food were both atrocious chaotic and not friendly certainly no yummy food here avoid saffron at all costs!!! is it possible to give a place lower than a 1 star on yelp ? seriously this place needs itlocated in an old strip mall on the east side of town the outside actually looks nice once you fight your way through the door it all seems to go down hill from thereas the only people in the place it was surprising to be ignored a request for a table for 6 took us to a table for 4yep this is how it would benow i should say we have eaten here before but my mother in law grabbed a groupon for the place so the choice was taken out of my handsmenus delivered a whole two of them for the 6 peoplefood and drinks orderedthen nothing for 30 minutes we sat nobody to check on drink refills etcto the food descriptions taken from their menu :veggie pakoras mixed vegititables in a special batter fried to a crispy brown by which they mean a mixture of onionsi actually love chicken pakoras the batter was ok but seriously if you are going to offer a mixture of vegetables actually serve a mixtureback to being ignored for another 20 minutesmixed tandoori combo  mixed tandoori combo seekh kabobchicken tikka botichicken tandoori (two) actually not bad the seekh kabob was probably the best thing i ate therechicken handi pieces of chicken cooked in a butter flavored cream sauce a not so good version of buttered chickenshrimp masala not listed on the one line menu but if you know indian you can figure it outblah pretty much blaha couple of orders of plain nan and garlic nan actually the second best thing behind the seekhmeal finish time to be ignored againseriously do these people have no idea on how to run a restaurant ? if you leave the floor unattended for 20-30 minutes at a time with the door jammed open people will walk out not pay bill get fed up and leaveso with a little bit of work the food could be ok the servicewell there is none so it doesnt applyif youre looking for a good indian meal try everest or india masala,1.5,4
The Cholas,i have been 6 times in 4 weeks thats how much i really like the cholas as i said in my previous review its hands down the best south indian food ive had in edinburgh if you think you know indian food this is very different to the british indian made up of heavy naans chicken tikka massala and vindaloo there are sauce-based curries but also lentil and rice crepe-like pancakes called dosas delicious small but buttery breads called paratha desserts like paniyaram and gulab jamun and of course mango lassis (a thick not-too-sweet mango milkshake)since ive been so often i can now recommend my favourites having tried many things on the menu:vegetarian curry mains:- brinjal curry: aubergine simmered in tomato quite sweet but also spicy- channa massala: chickpea curry so flavourful- dhal & spinach: lentils simmered to a sauce with lots of spinach creamy (but without dairy) and a bit mildermeat curry mains:- chicken chetinadu: mostly sauce based no veggies in the sauce but sweet and spicy (it is spiced with pepper not chilli so isnt too spicy)- lamb nilgiri: green in colour flavoured with mint but not overpoweringly so the lamb is so tendermeat mains (not curry):- lamb masala dosa a large thin crepe made of rice and lentil flour fried in ghee and stuffed with lamb and potatoes and spices its gluten free and really filling it comes with three types of chutney (one being coconut) and a small serving of sambar (lentil curry sauce)sides:- paratha: non-wheat bread (so gluten free i think made with corn) that is round flaky and absolutely delicious dipped in anything- coconut rice: all the rices come with spices nuts etc in them the coconut rice is by far the best no plain boiled rice heredesserts:- gulab jalum: a very sweet sticky not healthy small donut-type ball deep fried then soaked in sugar syrup decadent- paniyaram: less sweet than galub jalum a white small spongey ball with some sultanas in it and spices a bit lighter tooteas:- lemon and ginger tea even this is home-made no twinings tea bag herei know im giving brief descriptions of each but basically everything is home-made and with the best spices every single curry and dish ive had here tastes entirely different: no generic red creamy sauces with chunks of meat instead youll find star anise mixed up amongst the vegetables in your kurma and mustard seeds in the ricelike i said even the drinks are home-made (id also highly recommend their special lime drink very refreshing) and you can see the put a great amount of love into the foodthe portions are a bit smaller but the prices are lower which you means you can order more things to try and still leave very full but without overspendingi can see myself returning here many times more a lot they know me by name now and are always very welcoming and service with a smile is done so with the most genuine of mannersim so glad the cholas opened and long may it last!,5.0,1
Mint Indian Bistro,great quality food  much better than when it was himilayan cuisine  love that we got a free good quality mimosa w/ our weekend buffet  price not unreasonable food was amazing!  delicious chicken pakora (like indian chicken fingers) chicken tikka masala tamarind rice and spinach w/ chickpeas  my husband is vegan and there were some nice options for him too  will go back again soon!  :) not a big fan of buffets but i love me some chicken tikka masala the only problem i had was some of the items in the buffet were out and or there wasnt any chicken left in it and it was just sauce and they really didnt replace it but whatever was available was pretty good the bread was good to theres a lot of haters but it seems their issues stem from the lunch buffet of which we did not partake i went for a night out with my boyfriend and we opted for the indian sampler our server was also one of the lucky owners an extremely cordial and friendly man who recommended some delicious beers its obvious that hes a man who takes his libations seriously which we appreciated he explained that during the time of day we were there he opted to maintain the restaurant himself aside from showcasing an impressive work ethic it allows him to interact with his customers and gain insight on their reactions and feelings he takes an active interest in the reviews and responses of individuals and mentioned that he periodically updates this page himself :} so hi! thanks for the meal! we started with the don de dieu a canadian beer with a high alcohol percentage while still being light floral fruity and crisp it was a nice beverage to sample while awaiting our food and taking in the environment the interior is a pleasant cool green shade with dark wood tones on the tables floor and chairs that we found very soothing and appealing there are several pieces of art on the walls as well as iron work the bar is well stocked and there is a window that lets you peak into the kitchen gently wafting in the background was atmosphere music not too obtrusive but a pleasant additionthe first food that was brought to us were flat breads that were studded with cumin/coriander seeds they were folded over themselves and super thin with a light crunch and pleasant mouthfeel they were served with a mint and tamarind chutney the tamarind was sweet and tangy but the mint was cool and savory i vastly preferred the mint but we enjoyed both we were given a refill of the bread and sauces prior to our meal the sampler itself was brought out on a large metal tray with each dish presented in a small metal container initially it looked like it may not be that much food but as we began to ate we realized that the 9 small containers were  easily enough to feed 3 maybe even 4 light eaters with a refill of rice we were extremely satisfied the meal included; - fresh baked garlic naan : hearty flat breads with fresh herbs and garlic studded throughout served at the center of the platter and ideal for dunking into residual sauces/soup- vegetable pakodas : crispy deep fried bites of mixed vegetables excellent dipped into the tangy and rich homemade whole-milk yogurt and a dollop of ghost chili sauce- chicken tikka masala : creamy with hearty chunks of chicken in a sauce that gradually ramps up the heat in your mouth after a few bites it gains an addictive spice - lamb vindaloo : like a stew with a spice and sweetness differentiating it from the usual western stew i particularly enjoyed this and would look forward to ordering it again - organic tandoori chicken : tender flavorful chicken with a yummy spice rub coating the outside giving it a bright reddish-pink tinge there were two peices and they were a little small so this would be the only downside to ordering the platter for more than 2 people they  may be willing to adjust the serving for a larger party if you ask as they seem quite amicable :}- mixed vegetable curry of the day : ours had lots of zucchini chickpeas tomatoes and a rich sauce i probably wouldnt order this by itself but thats simply because i dug the other vegetable based dish so much more - chefs choice lentil soup : this was delicious! it had a strong turmeric flavor and color and was very flavorful the lentils werent very chunky so the soup itself was not exceedingly thick i enjoyed the consistency personally- fresh homemade whole-milk yogurt : one of my other favorite options it was extremely creamy with a rich tang and was an instant relief from some of the strongly flavored dishes a great way to cleanse your palate between dishes or dolloped on top of them - aromatic basmati rice : a chewier drier rice that easily soaked up much of the sauce from the dishes a good compliment as the texture of the rice really helped to enrich and fortify the thinner or lighter dishes- khir dessert : sweet rice pudding with what i thought may have been a hint of rosewater i ate most of it and really enjoyed it!while eating we enjoyed two other beers as well;yeti! an indian beer that had a hoppy smokey flavor it was more of a dry lager but went very very well with the food we really enjoyed it and asked our server about sourcing itwe ended with piraat a potent amber beer with an earthy tang and a hoppy afterbite also quite good but strong! i gave most of mine to the boy to finish so i could safely navigate our journey home i definitely intend to go back sometime for the lunch buffet and their other set menus its a great introduction to a new cultures cuisine in a  nice relaxed atmosphere with helpful and pleasant service that isas good as it getsin las vegas!!!!i have been coming here since i found it in its prior name himalayan restaurant  the first time i came here we used the coupon from restaurantcom  i had a hard time finding a good indo-pak restaurant so good thing there is restaurantcomfirst timeappetizerhimalayan samosas-potatoes and peas stuffed in a light fluffy pastry  butthe best thing about this is dipping it into the tamarind chutney  dang this is awesomechicken rebel curry-spicynot much else  i havent been ordering this  not memorable  lets move onlamb vindaloo-spicy and tons of flavor  the lamb was nice and tendergarlic naan-were not short of garlic  top that lamb vindaloo pieces with a shred of onion and dip it into the tamarind chutneywow!!mango lassi-is good as evermy friend said that coupon or no coupon we are coming back fo sho!!second timedidnt use a coupon so we were able to get:-indian sampler-3099--garlic naan--pakodas-dumpling kinda look with vegetable stuffed inside  the outside is a chickpea batter  this was dipped into a nutty sauceinteresting combination--chicken tikka marsala--lamb vindaloo--tandoori chicken-chicken was very juicy with a nice spice rub  --vegetable curry-for a vegetable curry this is so flavorful--yogurt (this was homemade it was super tarttoo tart for my taste)--basmati rice (i am used to the jasmine rice but this basmati is on a new playing field)--khir-dessert is this rice pudding (basmati rice! yay) in milk spiced with nuts and raisins  this is one of my favorite dessert  once again bursting with flavorsthis sampler was perfect  we got to tried out everything  recommend for adventurous newbies  they werent super spicy either so is easy on the tongue (and tummy) since there are so may other dish that one can alternate between the spicy onelamb vindaloothird time and so on:ghosht karahi (goat curry)-flavors remind me of back homeaahhhh i miss homeok focus!  so my routine comes to play  i ask for a side of onion and some lemon wedges  i mix the onion with the goat curry and squeeze lemon in it  its amazing how the onion would make the flavor even spicier and how the lemon juice brings out that tang!!!  now try this with the best naan that i have tasted yetthe naan with fruits in the middle  this is the only place that have it as far as i know  you get savory and sweet  have mango lassi with this entree is the perfect combination  of course i have the khir at the end of my every meal  service has always been super for me  the owners are sooooooo fantastic  they are so kind and wonderful  i love the decor  oh i forgot to mention they have a very extensive beer selection  my friends always order beer and try like three different kinds every time  i stick to my mango lassi and am happy with it note for those with restaurantcom certificates:apparently they have a conflict with restaurantcom and arent accepting their coupons however they honored the discount themselves and told us to get a refund for our certificate and will probably do the same for others he looked upset a bit explaining it so its probably something ugly i thought it was cool that they will honor it themselves to help out the customers *********for years i ate indian food on a weekly basis and for a while i stayed away since i burned out and the bf never had indian food before so away we went  the drink selection is one main reason that made me really want to try them we are beer nerds so it makes for a lovely surprise that a unassuming bistro would have such an impressive drink menu the bf wasnt sure of what and our server (i think possibly the owner) asked what kinds of flavors he likes and gave a few recommendations i always appreciate a place that knows what they sell since it seems most people dont care about beer the way they do of wine the bf took his suggestion of a augustjn abbey ale ($7) and i had a troubadour obscura ($7) which the guy poured into tulips with care to produce a proper head! i had a nerd moment that they had the proper kind of glasses and someone cared about our drinks as much as we do he treated it like a sommelier would a fine wine while we waited for food we were served papadam with a tamarind chutney and a cilrantro mint chutney all really finely made for food we really couldnt decide to we went with a indian sampler ($30) it doesnt look like a lot of food but we were both comfortably fullit includes:*chicken tikka masala- this was a lovely tikka ive had a lot and this was one of the better ones ive had very robust but balanced the bf loved this and raves its the best curry hes had and he had a foodie moment (aww i think us yelpers are getting to himmaybe hell change his mind about doing reviews one day) *lamb vindaloo- the lamb was very tender and the sauce complimented it very well with a bit earthiness tangyness and a tad spicy *tandoori chicken- crisp and nicely spiced outside juicy inside*mixed veggie curry- had a good mix of cauliflower zucchini beans peppers the curry had a very light and fragrant flavor to iti cant quite place the spices but i liked this *chef choice of lentils- today it was daal i like daal since its earthy and comforting *we got yoghurt basmati rice and garlic naan as well the naan was pretty noms here *khir came with it for dessert its a rice and milk porridge with raisins nuts and cardamom according to the menu when i was eating it to me it tasted more flowery than just cardamom like possible orange blossom water was added its the kind of light dessert that would be amazing for a hot summer day since its served cold and has such bright flavorswe also ordered another dessert that i thought i had and loved at another restaurant and at friends house but havent come across it in a while turns out it was what i was looking for! lal mohan ($299) the description says its served cold but its served piping hot! its these round pastries that are fried so the outside is crisp and the inside has a creamy kind of dough they throw it into syrup and it absorbs it so it flavors it throughoutthey come 3 to a serving in a shot glass balls are about gumball sized so you dont get much of it but its quality its a comforting kind of dessert that would be a good for people who like fried mochi with honey warm donuts zeppolis beignets the service was friendly and helpful i like the little details that show they care like having proper beer glasses or giving us warm plates utensils were impeccably polished- no water marks at all it felt very comfortable with the warm decor and the good staff making you feel good about being there i just got a strong feeling that they are proud of this place in the pride they take for the little details i havent been this surprisingly satisfied in a long time the bf was super happy with discovering indian food and having a food epiphany of sorts about itdays later hes still telling me about the tikka and how he wants to go next weekend  definitely we will be coming back for a la carte and also the buffet sounds like a deal if our next experience is as good as this one it can quickly grow to be a favorite ive always wanted to check this place out but never knew where it was until i passed it while we were on our way to mob month at the library i definitely wanted to try it so i kept a mental note for after the lecture we started off with drinks i had the rose lassi the rose flavor was really delicate it  didnt taste like i was consuming a rose garden my husband had the pomegranate martini he thought it was a little strong and so did i but i dont think that taste can be avoided when you are mixing juice with vodka ive had a martini made with baileys before i think thats more my speed i dont think it was a true martini but the taste is much smoother i ordered the half order of lamb biryani $999 it was good but while i was eating it i came across some very strong spices you know the feeling when you accidentally bite into a peppercornit felt like that but im not sure what type of spice it was it looked like a miniature piece of a tree branch but the tender lamb made up for it my husband ordered the chicken tikka salad $599 the seasonal veggies that came with salad were super fresh good size cucumbers tomatoes and chicken beautiful colors it tasted good too! its perfect for a late night snack that will not weigh you down it tasted even better when you put some of the salad on the naan and roll it up my husband agreed that i know what im talking about it because he liked it  thats no easy feat we wanted to try some dessert so i ordered the mango kulfi its basically a milky mango ice cream its not sour like a sorbet it was pretty tasty my husband went out of his vanilla box of his basic dessert choices  he also had no choice because there is no ice cream sundaes here! he ordered the lal mohan which looked kind of like like juicy brown eggs i thought the he might be scared off by it but he tried it and like it i tried some too  if you are the type that doesnt like too much syrup on your french toast then this may not be for you im one of those people these are milk based pastries drowning in syrup it was cool trying something new though the service was awesome ! our waiter helped us decide on the desserts  he genuinely cared what we thought of the foodwhich was refreshing  the waiter had a nice warm personality where when he said hope you come back soon you have to believe him! my husband and i have been to several indian restaurants in vegas and this one is our favorite  we drive all the way to mint from summerlin b/c the closer indian places just dont make food as good as mint doesrestaurant is clean simple decor staff is nice and you cant beat the $999 lunch buffet they offer  buffet isnt huge but does offer enough delicious choices to be satisfied  also comes with naanim especially a fan of the chicken tikka masalaits my favorite indian dish and they know how to make it right here  definitely check them out when youre in the mood for a good indian meal overall: great indian food at a reasonable pricemy boyfriend and i had a hankering for indian food the last time we were in vegas and with all the good reviews on yelp we decided to try the indian mint bistrowhen we placed our order the server was playing with his iphone while taking our drink orders i thought this was a bit rude but he explained that they have an app to place orders pretty cool we started off with a salty mango lassi which was deliciousfor our main course we ordered the indian sampler ($3099) that featured garlic naan veg pakodas chicken tikka masala lamb vindaloo tandoori chicken mixed veg curry lentils yogurt rice and a milky rice pudding (khir) we liked the idea of having a little taste of everything and boy did we! the food was outstanding but the servings were kind of small i was satisfied but my boyfriend could have eaten more they did bring out more rice when they saw we were getting low  tip: they also serve halal meats and they will call a cab for you when your meal is over it was kind of freaky walking in at 7:40pm to an empty restaurant but we braved it and stayed  and it was wonderfully yummy!  like sara m i also thought our waiter was being kind of rude playing with his phone when he approached our table to take our order but i realized he was using his phone for ordering what a cute little trick  im glad i refrained from scolding him before i knew what he was doing because i know you never want to piss off your waiter before you get your food  we had the normal stuff--garlic naan saag paneer and chicken tikka masala and a large kingfisher  all was so great we are looking forward to coming back next year  the only disappointment was that the naan was not part of the meal we had to order it separately and they gave us a double order because we both said naan  we ate lots of naan  erpand the restaurant did get busier 3 more tables walked in after us  it was a monday after all   service was extremely polite as well  we hope to see you next year mint!  (so please dont close) another lunch for 1 please i went here on a tuesday for the $999 lunch buffet i got basmati rice: good garlic naan: good chicken tikka masala: cubed chicken breast was a bit on the dry side chicken tandori: flavorful chicken pakoda: basically battered fried chicken i cant remember the name of the noddles i had but they were vegetarian and super spicy all in all it was alright good variety of items with descriptions of what sauces they would go well with and if they were vegan/vegetarian eh nothing screams i must come back here was anything wrong? not really was anything great? yes fresh naan of your choice but now do we go to indian restaurants for the naan alone? no they have a lot of vegan choices on the buffet which i certainly wasnt there for i enjoyed their version of chicken tikka masala it was lighter had chunks of tomato in it i didnt feel super guilty eating it my husband did not like it as much as the creamier versions i enjoyed the chicken chili nice and spicy first time i ever had chicken chili at an indian restaurant the restaurant was clean with newer furniture so anyhow we will not be back there are at least two other indian restaurants in vegas that my husband and i prefer check it out if you feel like it if you dont no loss this place was so good!! the decor was chic and the service staff was very nice and helpful the menu was huge (sometimes a bad sign) but everything we ordered & every dish that passed our table looked and smelled delicious we had been craving indian food so before we stepped foot in the restaurant we already knew we were going to order momo and chicken tikka masala lucky for us wednesday happened to be chicken tikka masala night which means if we bought one wed get the 2nd one half off (you can choose the level of spiciness you prefer) along with the naan this meal really hit the spot im not from the area but i will definitely come back here anytime im in vegas again just to try more tasty dishes especially those on the prix fixe menu! i am from nj and an indian nj has large indian population but there are only two restaurants that are good i moved to lv two years ago and i had been trying out different indian restaurants for sometime when i went to mint for first time i thought that this was best indian restaurant in lv apart from namaste i just could not believe that ive not written a review on this so here is my experience from last weekendlast weekend i went to mint with my friends and my gf some of them had never been to indian restaurant they were excited to try it out so we ordered the followingshrimp khadhai - $19chicken tikka - $15lamb rebel curry - $153 butter naan (my gfs favorite)- $91 bhathura - $299daal mahkhni (lentils) - $13chicken biryani (fried rice) - $152 chaat appetizer - $16we ordered everything very spicy and it was delicious specially the shrimp khadhai my mouth is watering just writing about it also the free basmati rice that comes with the curries is very delicious and smells amazing all the curries were amazing the chicken biryani was little over cooked but it was spiced wellmy only complaint that i would have is that their full size portions are very small and their full size portions are way smaller than their some restaurants half sized now i know its a good trick to get your customers to buy more food but i think they should be honest on their serving size final bill was $140 plus $30 tip for 5 people not that bad but we had to order more food and we did not order any alcoholpositives  - delicious food - good ambiance negatives - prices seem unreasonably high for the quantity of food (i guess thats what happenes when a restaurant gets famous)overallits just as good as namaste if not better pstheir lunch buffet is good but its not as good when you order of the menu went on a recommendation of a friend in our dining party who had heard of mint via word of mouth but also had never been himself either  located in an unassuming strip mall mint is somewhat of a buried treasure in vegas  we went for dinner and were seated in a spacious booth the restaurant itself was almost packed at 8:00pm  the menu itself is extensive but also descriptive and keyed for vegetarian/vegan items gluten free spicy etc  very impressive regional beer selection i had never tried indian beers before  our party of three enjoyed the garlic naan vegatable samosas and the crispy flatbread that was brought to the table was toasted perfectly  for our mains we enjoyed chicken tikka masala lamb biryani rogan josh (with lamb) and i loved loved loved the buttered masala dosa i ordered  (i had been craving a proper dosa for months!)  various chutneys were brought to the table as well  all of the items were delivered with good timing and were all equally delicious with tender chicken and lamb  at the time of your order you can designate how spicy youd prefer your meat/curry dishes (on a scale of 1-10)  our server was hilariously talking us into spicier levels and we were glad we agreed with his recommendations in the end    we ended with the small dessert offerings of which i cant remember the name but all were lovely and petite served in tall shotglasses it seemed  total bill for three adults with one alcoholic drink and one soda $100 with tax mint is definitely a jewel hidden in the vegas rough we will be back indefinitely  if not on this trip then the next this is a great little indian restaurant or maybe ive lost how to rate indian restaurants since the indian restaurants in austin just plain suck (at least most of them)the lunch buffet had a decent variety of vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes along with a salad bar and two desserts(it was gulab jamun and something else) i dont like desserts so i cant comment on them; the vegetarian dishes kadhai paneer saag mushroom potatoes dal sambar idli rasam pulao were all great in the non veg section there was chicken tikka masala chilli chicken tandoori chicken goat curry and another chicken dish they all were great; i ate a bit of each coz it was that good also they bring your choice of bread fresh at your table unlike other indian restaurants who leave theirs at the buffet tableoh yeah if youre indian and drink iced/cold water you need to tell them that the default water for us folks is warm water :) so i went here with one of my friends and i was really excited for the place we are seated relatively quickly and it takes awhile to finally get menus from our waiter that did not really bother me too much but it gets better after ordering a series of dishes it takes unusually longer than it should have and when we got our food there was hair in the chicken tikka masala and rice yes - three hairs in each one i was shocked and disgusted at this we immediately inform the staff of this and receive a half-baked apology but they replace it with no problem we get the food back but now our naan is cold so we ask for the naan to be warmed or get new naan they oblige and we get new naan my friend takes a bite into his potatoes that we got and there yet again another hair but this one being smaller i have never been to place that allows its cooks to leave hair in the food it is very careless of them i was expecting amazingly service but was met with subpar service i expected amazing food but i was met with hair in the food i will not be back here too gross to eat hair in the food foodies beware! ive found over the years that trying an indian restaurant during their lunch buffet is by far the best value and a great way to try new things without being disappointed if you dont really like it i love chicken tikka masala unfortunately mints didnt really tickle my fancy as much as i was hoping it would it was good but not as flavorful as im used to that being said they had other dishes that were delish! i liked their chili chicken and chicken vindaloo their garlic naan was fluffy and yummy and both rice dishes were good give this place a try! the lunch buffet cant be beat here!! the price is super cheap and the food is very good! is it worth the hour long wait one time when the line was out the door and had to wait a super long time for a lunch at 2pm on a thursday ehh??? the buzz must have gotten out cause this place was packed for lunch  the garlic naan is super fresh and keeps coming out when asked for  the selections at the buffet are all tasty and good  my go to indian food is always chicken tikka tandori rice and goat curry which are all good here the tandori is not too dry (which happens often for indian buffets i noticed) and the goat curry has lots of actual goat meat  spicy factor is definitely there so be warned!! i also ordered a mango lassi but that was ok i think it was a pre-made from a carton though boo :( which is a little disappointing  the only issue is when its packed the service gets a little slower and the wait is pretty long since people do not want to leave without getting more than their moneys worth  you know a place is super good when its native people are taking over the place not trying to be racist but this place was full of indians and their huge families so it must be good right?!  dont miss out on this place and lunch is very good cheap eats for great food!! finishing the last episode of gordon ramseys great escape; i had the strongest urge for some flavor packing curries and was instructed to come here by my over-zealous vegan friend this restaurant has such a wide variety of curries of non-vegan and vegan selections  their buffet runs from 11am-3pm and might i say something everyone should become very familiar with  the buffet is only $12 and it comes with such a variety of foods its such a steal!  considering i came here for dinner and ordered chicken tikka masala (buttered chicken) and naan; the bill came out to about $18  the buffet includes chicken/vegetable tikka masala tandoori chicken basmati rice bone-in lamb curry and more dishes i cant pronounceit includes normal and garlic naan! the curry is packed with so much flavor the naan comes out freshly made (hot) the meat of the tandoori and chicken tikka masala is slightly dry but other than that i really cant complain food is an a- for methe only complaint i have is for dinner; their portions are a bit small for what you pay for but nonetheless still very tastyservice is spot on and punctual whenever youre out of drink naan or if you have empty plates; oh yeah their naan is refillable!  our server was extremely friendly wasnt overbearing and took care of us throughout the whole dinnerambiance was very warm lights dim but not dungeness and with trending indian songs to add culture to a very modern looking restaurant  despite having a few indian restaurants surrounding this area ill always return to mint for their money worthy buffet vegan optionsaffable and attentive service and their delicious food in looking at the reviews on mint; i had my expectations set very high when walking into this small resturant they were quite busy when we arrived after 8pm on a saturday night but the wait wasnt too long though there wasnt a place to sit down inside (it was a cold night in vegas) youll see that i frequent indian restaurants fairly regularly wherever i travel so i know what i like and how it compares to other establishments my family and i decided to go with the chefs northern india tasting menu and were given a plethora of different dishes though with smaller than normal portions we all enjoyed the pakora (they called them pakodas) and again thought we were in for the best indian meal in a long time that being said the lamb vindaloo was rather skimpy on the lamb (and it was tougher than it should have been) the chicken tikka masala had great flavor; but was more masala than chicken and the daal was good but just a tad undercooked i was also disappointed when i asked for a 6-7 spicy i received something more like a 2 or 3 they do have something they call inferno chili sauce but i thought my dishes came from a very universal pot thats geared to less spice (and flavor) as other reviewers have noted their naan bread is excellent service was satisfactory but i never felt like i was being served meaning it was more obligatory than driven all in all a good indian meal though i have had better for less money mint is my favorite indian restaurant in the valley  i love coming here not only because its near unlv but because its really good  you cant beat $1099+tax for a delicious lunch buffet with 10% off if youre a unlv student  it just doesnt happentheir butter naan is so yummy; i have to remember not to fill up on that so i can fit more delicious food in me  my ocdness likes that they organize their buffet trays from starters to sides to entrees  they used to have a dessert warmer at the very end but i think they nixed this because not enough people were utilizing it during the lunch hoursmy favorites are (and i will definitely butcher the correct names of these items): the yellow indian fried rice with vegetables fried vegetables the noodles with vegetables chicken tikka masala (i know that one!) goat curry and spicy chili chicken  im pretty sure ive tried everything there but these are my go to dishesthe 5 stars comes from food and price alone  they really do have delicious high quality food  the service is consistently mediocre if not subpar but if im at mint its for the food  also it takes awhile for drinks to come out especially if you order coffee  i dont know if its a cultural thing but ive almost always received my coffee at the end of my meal i would prefer it as an accompaniment to my meal  and getting your bill can take awhile too sometimes  if i have to leave i just go up to the counter and payand fair warning you will leave the restaurant full and with a lingering fragrance on your clothing and hair for the rest of the day you were warned! we were visiting las vegas and were craving indian food mint had a lot of good reviews and we decided to check this place out the crowd was extremely young and the place was lively the decor was okay with muted sounds of indian cinema music in the background the menu was very innovative -- almost every appetizer and entree had a twist we are vegetarian and so this review wont help if you are looking to hear about the chicken tikka masala (which i am told is good) so we ordered the organic samosa and vegetable pakoras we also ordered the mahakali mango masala (yes that is the real name) dal maharani balti and the hariyali kabab after a long day of gallivanting we were hungry and would have eaten anything cooked :-)for the food then while the names were innovative the food not so much the hariyali kabab was green (as expected) but was bland the chutneys were basted on a bit too much and there was literally no spice the mahakali mango masala was similarly taste free and bland we had ordered this with paneer and it was undercooked the dal wasnt bad and probably the only item that was tasty enough the breads on the other hand were fresh and nicealso there were a lot of innovative lassi types these were very nice as well perhaps the items with meat were better and the crowd was generally having a lot of fun! so we might have been the unlucky group this place is definitely worth a visit just to see the creativity in the menu we went for a sit down dinner and i was completely satisfied with my experience ordered the malai kofta and the chicken tikka masala which both tasted very good the naan was also very good maybe a little fluffier in shape as opposed to flat like i am used to but delicious this is the best indian food i have had in town so far also the interior of the place is beatiful lit romantically and well decorated i will go back for the lunch buffet next time the service was good and we did not have to wait long to get our food dinner portions might be small to some people i thought it was plenty of food though this place is the best indian food ive had in all of vegasexcept it being super cold in there everything else was perfectthey actually make the food spicy herewe ordered samosas as an app the tamarind chutney was the best ive ever hadfor dinner i got the chicken tikka masala at level 8 hot! and the hubbs got a veggie khorma at a level 7also supper hot!the raita (yogurt) was a smaller order than i wouldve liked but it was really good parking is very limited i would recommend car pooling if you are coming with a group the inside is very quaint they even have a cute little patioi went during the lunch buffet and it was pretty good i may be butchering the name of this because my phone autocorrected to andrea and now i cant remember what it was called but the ankur? chicken curry was amazing chicken literally melted in my mouth the flavor was perfect by far my favorite item the chicken chili was also pretty good pieces of chicken made with chopped up chunks of red and green bell peppers reminded me of chicken jalfrezichicken tikka masala was a different color than ive normally seen it was ok but i think i had a hard time getting past the way it looked i just couldnt eat it i prefer mine to be more consistently creamy and a little darker in color this one was almost the color of salmonthe chicken ttandoori was as good as ive ever had before definitely worth it i didnt see raita on the buffet line i probably could have asked for it but they were really busy and i didnt want to be a bother i guess i was really thirsty because i finished my first glass of water quickly instead of refilling it the server set a carafe of water on my table now that i think of it he never asked me what i wanted to drink good thing i wanted water because thats what he brought me the naan could have been better it seemed to be a little dry or hard i dont think it was fresh they were a lot of veggie/vegan options and the ones i tried were pretty good (potato sag aloo and a few others)bathrooms are small only one stall per sex it is difficult to find a place to satisfy my girlfriends and i since we have a vegan a picky eater and someone who has never tried other ethnic foods besides mexican and american  it was pretty pack considering it was late sunday evening however we were able to get a table right away and the food came out fast they have a huge menu that is also vegan & gluten-free friendly (i guess all indian food) the menu is well organized and laid out with symbols next to each dish to help the diners that have diet restrictions almost every dish can be made into vegan or vegetarian they also have chicken tofu and cheese options we ordered the onion/cilantra paratha organic veggie samosas mighty momos with veggie chicken tikka masala (hot level 5-it was not spicy) mixed chefs killer kabob organic alo gobi masala monterey jack cheese naan and lastly mango and pistachio kulfi for deserts not 1 bad dish everything was very good including their chutneys i do wish they gave more rice since they only gave us 2 small bowls to share between 3 people they seemed to be reasonbly priced  our server ronald was great and very helpful the ambience of the place was nice too  it was relaxing and calming you know its a good indian restraunt when it is packed with indian diners! overall we are very happy and cant wait to go back really delicious indian food and good service  some of the best saag ive had in a while and chicken tikka masala had a rich hearty sauce  will definitely go back went for lunch buffet - it was just ok ive definitely had betterchicken tikka masala was dry (even though it was buried in gravy) pakora was burnt to a crispfresh garlic naan brought to table was wonderful - so was the tandoori chicken - juicy and flavorful i came here around 8:30 on a saturday night and was surprised at how busy it was every table was full or had reservations except for one table outside and a small two person table top inside my friend and i chose the small table top inside because the outside area didnt look too appetizingi ordered the pakoda as an appetizer for the first time i usually order the samosas even though i am not a huge fan the pakoda was fried and had a nice flavor but i didnt taste much indian spice i also ordered the chicken tikka masala malai kofta garlic naan and mango lassi all of the curries were solid my only complaint is that everything came out luke warm except for the garlic naan the garlic naan came out piping hot and i had to wait a while until i was able to tear it because it was not cut mango lassi was one of the best i have had and even though i was full i drank all of itbest indian i have tried in vegas but portions are kind of small for the price point the buffet is great! lamb korma and chicken tikka masala are my faves and it is included in the lunch buffet! the interior of the place makes you feel like youre in a fine dining restaurant prices were reasonable i will be coming back,4.0,30
Madras Ananda Bhavan,most of the indian restaurants serve north indian food i was looking for something different and decided to visit the madras ananda bhavana based on the positive reviews on yelp thankfully i was not disappointedthe quality of their food was surprisingly authentic - the medu vadas the idlis and the (freshly prepared) masala dosas were awesome! i almost felt like i was in a udipi restaurant in bangalorethe level of spice was toned down probably to better suit the palate of the localsthere arent too many indian restaurants that serve vegetarian food and this place more than makes up for the lack of meat! the kadai paneer or the bagara baingan have enough punch to knock off your cravings for the ubiquitous chicken tikka masala & co  the service was good and prompt in all an absolute value for money deal for people looking out for south indian meals i love this place  we go there on the weekends to enjoy their veggie buffet  after five times we realized that we hadnt had the same dish twice  the dosas are fantastic  and appropriately spicy  its been a while since ive been to udapi but this place seems better from what i recall  no alcohol or meat so any review referring to chicken tikka means they havent been there,4.5,2
Passage To India,coworker and i had wanted to try passage to india since we heard they opened so off we went at high noon on a thursday  they had a nice lil lunch crowd and we were there to try out the lunch buffet it had a nice amount of items to pick from  but i was sold on the chicken tikka masala & vegetable biryani  i cannot even tell you how much i had been cravin tikka masala and with the garlic naan bread it was the perfect dish! for a new place the service was lil slow but i just counted that as being new and am ready to try them for lunch again soon! we got a vegetarian take out yesterday night  the paneer kati roll was good the aloo mutter and naan were ok nothing to write home about the ras malai was just awful it was like the milk was burnt!but the worst part of our night was that when we had ordered paneer tikka masala we were given chicken tikka masala we went home and started to cut the supposedly paneer in the entree only to realize it was chicken now it is understandable that the order got mixed up but what irked me was that when i called them to tell about it the owner acted like its not possible and that i was mistaken even though we are vegetarian we know what chicken looks like he was extremely rude and asked me to come all the way back to the restaurant to examine the dish himself or to email photos of it i decided to do neither coz i was completely pissed at the way this was handled i wouldnt have minded if i hadnt gotten my money back but to treat a customer like this all for $10 is unacceptable for me terrible way to run a business and that too when it is new!anyway were never going back and recommend that people check their dish before eating it coz they are never going to accept their mistake over priced and below average food there are better indian restaurants in tempe mango lassi that we ordered was salty and watery it was the weirdest mango lassi that ive had so far the other dishes that we ordered were chicken tikka masala malai kofta and chilly pakora the chilli pakoras were soggy and not crisp at all and the other two were average all and all i would give this place a miss for the next time three of us went for dinner this visittikka masala korma & andhra curry - all chickenbutter garlic & paneer naanchicken 65 appetizereverything was served with white rice the naan was all very good soft with just a hint of toastiness not too drythe chicken 65 was unremarkable lightly spicy with lots of onion and cilantrothe chicken korma was ordered extra mild for the non spice eater in the group and come out spot on very flavorful without any heat the chicken itself was bonless tender and absorbed the flavors wellthe chicken andhra curry was ordered medium but came out a little over spicy and astringent the aroma hinted of flavorful spices but was overwhelmed by the heat of the dish surprisingly the chicken was served bone-in! the chicken was swimming in sauce which made it not finger food and made enjoying it more of a task the chicken tikka masala was spot on for both flavor and spiciness the let down was the chicken itself dense cubes of chicken breast the chicken was dry and absorbed none of the wonderful flavor in the sauce nothing was really bad just not fantastic worth another visitmaybe for their lunch buffet too if you have not been to passage to india you are missing out! this was only the second time i had tried indian food the first was at a buffet and while i liked the flavors nothing really stood out to me tonight i got a taste of what really good indian food is started with the kati roll with chicken at the suggestion of our nice server they were flavorful and the sauce for them was terrific i had the chicken tikka masala and hubby tried the chicken curry both were so good i would have licked the bowl had there not been other customers around usalso had garlic naan and gulab jamun for desert there was a seperate bar area and happy hour prices looked great $2 beers $4 absolut drinks everything was so delicious i cant wait to go back! oh yum - this place is just deeeelish! im always on the search for really good indian restaurants and this has quickly become my favorite its a nice set-up with friendly servers and complete with a bar the food is fantastic we usually go for dinner and have ordered a number of dishes the prawns are always large the chicken tikka masala is divine and the naan is perfect tonight we tried the chicken makhani (spl?) and the chicken andhra they were both just fantastic you could taste the grilled chardness of the chicken in the makhani and the depth of the flavors in the andhra were amazing the makhani is quite a rich dish and the andhra was served chicken none in (which keep in mind gives you really tender meat) dont give this place a miss josie the server is always super pleasant and very knowledgable about the menu! best chicken tikka masala in town  the only place we will ever come to for indian food! more like passage to give me my money back mutha mutha!!listen to me people im an indian food snob this is average indian food at the very best if youre in the tempe area you can do muuuuuch better with a place like kebab palace india gate or even the dhabathis place has a great location but it looks like some friends took what was in there garage found a used hot food table on craigslist and stuck it in a corner of the restauranttandoori chicken that tasted boiled and had literally no flavor dry naanthe chicken tikka masala was decentvegatable pakora that was cold along with most other dishesno salt no pepper available and lastly and most irritaingly not spicy at all!skip it and save your moneythe suck!!!!,3.0,8
India Garden,im rating the buffet as someone who has had indian food around the world (ie im not giving a filtered subjective strictly americanized perspective)  let me start with the pros:  the price is decent at $999/ person for lunch and the variety is decent  samosas saag chicken tikka basmati tandoori chicken and more along with a little salad bar with some gulab jamun  the naan was probably the highlight as it was super tasty and came out piping hotnow for the cons:  the food is extremely bland  there wasnt an ounce of spice (as in spiciness) and everything (expect the naan) tasted pretty much the same  for those who are looking for un-americanized indian-food you indubitably know that this is a big no-no as far as indian food goesaside from the taste again the price and quantity still offers a decent deal  if i went again id probably just stick to the tandoori naan samosas and some raita on the side went for the first time the food was very good the service was excellent the staff was very helpful in describing their dishes was prompt and accommodating with a smile   i will go back chicken tikka marsala was great the beau and i stopped by on a whim whilest exploring our new city and its probably the best find so far walking in for a late dinner we were happily greeted and easily seated service was prompt and pleasant we ordered some garlic naan chicken tikka masala and chicken vidaloo all came out within 10 minutes and boy was it amazing! the tikka masala was creamy and fresh my beau ordered his vidaloo spicy and it was the perfect amount of spicy  weve been back at least 8x since and always end up happily full (itis!)i cant wait to try the lunch buffet!,4.333333333333333,3
Tamba Indian Cuisine & Lounge,located in the hawaiian market this is a hidden gem that many may over look at first i was a little hesitant to try indian food but what better way to try it than with my indian bf and his entourage of cousins aunties uncles and parents? we came here one saturday evening for dinner and i fell in love with the setting its nothing like restaurants you see on the strip it had a buffet large lounge love seats with over stuffed pillows and an orange and gold scheme that made you feel like you were in india itself (or so i imagined)being with the crowd i was with it was great because some of them were not too fond of extremely spicy food so we got a lot of mild dishes you can just tell the staff to make it mild and they will do so the vegetarian dishes were great we started off with dishes like the kurkari bhindi- okra with brown onions and had chicken tikka for our entree  the naan had a great texture for scooping up all the sauce left over i really enjoyed the dining experience and i think that i owe my love for indian food to this restaurantthis is a great for a first timer!!! we went in a group of 6 for their saturday lunch buffet the vegetarian dishes were pretty good- saag paneer paneer matar daal rice etc the non veg werent that good except for the chicken tikka idlis tasted like they were microwaved from having prepared them a few days ago sambar wasnt too bad the gulab jamoon was ok hard to cut with a spoon overall it was ok considering it is one of the very few indian food options on the strip indian food for two?  walking upstairs at the hawaiian marketplace youll be surprised to see this dimly lit restaurant and its ample seating area  they offer a buffet lunch and dinner a la carteits hard when you want to try a bunch of different stuff when its just you and the bf  but tamba offers a couple of feasts to help satisfy that curiosity!for $25 the bf got the ashokas feast which comes with:* tandoori chicken spring chicken in a mildly spiced ginger yogurt sauce - it came with two drumsticks and two breasts a decent amount to start his meal  there were three dipping sauces - the mint one a chutney of some sort and a dark purplish one  im not a particular big fan of tandoori but the bf ate three pieces of it* lamb curry cubes of lamb cooked with onions tomatoes garlic red chilies and pickling spices - it tasted a bit gamey for me but we did enjoy dipping our nan bread into the sauce* chicken tikka masala chunks of boneless chicken roasted in the clay oven and then served in a mild curry sauce - the chicken was white meat and pretty flavorless  but the curry sauce was so good!  i wish i had a bucket of that to dump all over my rice and to smother my nan bread with!  next time ill tell them to skip the chicken and give me more of that sauce!* kali dal slow cooked black lentils with a medley of spices the bf thought this would taste just fabulous in a burrito as in skip the black beans refried beans or pinto and add some black lentils instead  pretty tasty stuff and good with the nan bread too* rice - a generous scoop coupled with a few green peas for decoration  needed to enjoy all the lovely sauces the meal has to offer* nan white flour tandoori bread - a must when eating indian food  my preferred choice when soaking up any kind of curries especially those that come with tikka masalas! * raita - condiment based on yogurt used as a sauce or dip  served chilled and has a cooling effect when eating spicy dishes  im not a big fan of the raita and was only dumping it on the rice cuz the bf was doing it  i can pass on this  * daily dessert - two small donut-like holes sitting in a bath of butter and honey  oh so sweet and a nice finish after a hearty indian dinneri ordered up the buddhas feast for $21 and this is what i got: * vegetable samosa crisp golden brown pastries stuffed with mildly seasoned potatoes and peas - the order came with two samosas and two dipping sauces  the bf was pretty impressed by these and im lucky that i had two to share!* malai kofta chunks of cheese tossed in a mild buttery cream sauce - it came with one chunk of cheese only which i couldnt even tell was cheese! i thought it was a mixture of chickpeas or something  the sauce was okay and good for dipping * saag paneer spinach with our special cottage cheese cooked in a karahi with house spices - it came with one piece of cottage cheese and i think it lacked flavor  the bf said it had been sitting out too long and this is one of his favorite indian dishes* kali dal* rice* nan* raita* daily dessertthe feasts are presented quite nicely on a large platter and its a decent amount of food  you definitely get the chance to taste a few different things without breaking the budget or ordering too much foodthe bf also ordered a mango lassi that he found a bit too sweet for his liking  i thought it tasted fine but was more watery than what im used toservice was good - our water glasses were filled without asking  the only complaint was that our main courses came out too quickly after our appetizers  we had to help the waiter move some dishes around while we were still eating and he was juggling the huge platterstheres also a back room available for private parties with a more family style seatingsidenote: you can get a 50% off coupon/entree at the tix4less booth downstairs! or a 10% coupon from their website(check out the pics of our eating in the business profile!) oh yelpers how you have failed me!  my boyfriend and i found tambas advertisement in one of vegass books during our visit and decided to go here for dinner after reading the good reviews and ratings on yelp  after finally having eaten there  i would give this place half a star if i could for its bad food and terrible service!i live in silicon valley---a mecca of indian restaurants and cafes-- and eat indian food at least once a week (its my latest addiction)  i know good curry when i taste it and let me tell you now before you waste your time and money: you will not find good curry herewe went for the dinner buffet which it turns out was reserved for private parties only so we ended up ordering the butter chicken and a lamb curry with some naan off of the menu  but the waiter brought out what he called chicken tikka masala and when we told him it wasnt what we ordered he then said he misspoke and it was actually butter chicken after alleither way it tasted like water  no flavor whatsoever  the lamb curry on the other hand was a spoonful of salt with every bite  yuck!ive never abandoned an indian meal in my life no matter how mediocre  but i could not get myself past even half this meal  maybe the bland curry juxtaposed to the salty one made it seem even saltier or maybe i thought if i mix the two curries together i would find a happy medium  how wrong i was! there was no happiness to be found there :(to top it off when our bill came we were charged $15 for the chicken tikka masala instead of butter chicken and told our server about the mistake  he said it doesnt matter anyway theyre the same price  indeed not!  i corrected him and said that the butter chicken is $14  so he responded fine ill just comp you the differencecomp? comp??? are you kidding me?!  youre not comping us anything!  were just asking you to charge us for what we actually ordered!  dont think youre doing us any favors!finally just to add insult to injury they advertised 10% off the bill if you showed them the ad from the vegas 24/7 booklet  but when we gave him the coupon instead of taking 10% off he added 18% to our bill for gratuity!ha! unbelievable  i guess in vegas  you dont have to go to the casinos to lose your money! i came here with my coworkers after a long boring sunday at work eating here was definitely the highlight of my day we ordered:-chicken tikka: delicious cubes of flavorful chicken served with sides of mint as well as tamarind sauces -tandoori chicken: delicious preperation i only wish the cuts of chicken were meatier -chicken tikka masala: my favorite dish full of flavor and soft tender chicken pieces the sauce base is perfect for dipping your naan into -chicken vindaloo: the spice level was perfect it was spicy enough for those who are adventurous but it wasnt so spicy that is took away from the wonderful flavor -yellow fried rice: great flavor perfect accompaniment to the tandoori chicken -naan: plain butter and garlic : both were excellent flaky with a soft fluffy center -drinks: bombay 7 sapporo beer strawberry daiquiri  the service was fantastic both from the waiter and the bussers the ambiance was excellent and the decor and dishes they used to serve the food were very modern i would not hesitate to take a date here i disagree with any bad comments on this place! maybe the buffet isnt the greatest but in general buffets are never that good all the food just sits around on that note me and my boyfriend went and ate here about a week ago bc a friend i had in my summer class at unlv worked here  although he wasnt there that night we went anyways and everyone was so nice  the service was excellent and the food was fantastic  i completely disagree with the yelp from sang whatever bc we ordered the chicken tikka masala and it was awesome  we also got the lamb vindaloo and the combo together was phenomenal  the chicken tikka was so buttery and had a great flavor while the lamb vindaloo had the perfect amount of heat  we had samosas of course and they were pretty good  from my memory ive had better but everything else was delicious  our water was never empty and everyone was so nice  we also had some dessert a round cake like ball thing (dont know what its called) and some carrots  very good as well  the location is a little strange (i thought it was closed when we were going there) but they were open  the atmosphere was great the service was great and the food was awesome  the rest of the night me and my boyfriend kept saying how nice of a dinner that was and have been craving indian food ever since! a+ i read the reviews of this place before coming and found it interesting that there was such a spread of opinions  my experience with yelp reviews has been that they tend to clump together around a mutually-agreed upon rating but this one had people who loved it and people who hated it  my fellow diner and i agreed that 35 stars is just about the correct rating thoughimpressions: the place is nicely decorated with low light and soft music  it is upstairs in a a grim looking food court in the back of a low-rent outdoor shopping center  it has a nice ambiance once inside though  we went for the lunch buffet  pros: very friendly and attentive staff  my water glass never reached the half-way empty mark  plenty of vegetarian selections in the buffetthe chicken tikka masala and a paneer curry (i missed the name) were both very goodcons: the daal was overly saltysome dishes were just okay and not spectacularoverall we had a nice lunch here but ive had better indian buffets in the bay area  in the midst of a sea of burgers and undercooked pizza slices however this is a welcomed change *weekend lunch buffet review*our plan was to find some grub at aria but we either found stuff that was too expensive or not very appealing by this time we were starving so i whip out my trusty iphone and used my yelp app to find this place just across the street its located in the hawaiian marketplace all the way in the backthe first thing we did after we entered was pay the $15 for the weekend lunch buffet i thought that was a bit strange but if the hotel buffet places can do it why not they had a lot of variety at least 14 different items and thought everything was just ok one thing i thought was really good was their upma its like an indian version of the moroccan cous cous it was my first time having the dish and it was simple yet very tasty the chicken tandoori had good flavor but was a little dry the chicken tikka masala sauce was good but there wasnt a lot of chicken i had to dig around for some what i noticed is that this place supplied small containers for the different dishes ive never seen that before and thought its a good idea for those who dont like mixing their food they were pretty good with refilling our water cups and clearing our dirty plates bad thing with this buffet was drinks werent included so a separate bill was handed to us another downside was the food wasnt labeled properly so i was just grabbing things blindly overall it was just an ok experience at least tamba introduced me to a new dish now all i have to do is find it here in la! me and my mom went to dinner here tonight it was awesome and mega yummy food wise we got the petite veggie samosas which were delish but a bit small i got a lassi which was yummy we also got rice and chicken tikka masala which was so good i highly recommend we also had naan which was nothing special but good non the less now service wise it was great not only was it super quick and my water was always full everyone was super nice we had the best server ever not only was he fantastic to talk to very attentive and so sweet he was also incredibly cute i would def rank him in one of my favorite waiters ever i cant wait to go back and eat their again this was my indian food de-flowering experience (so i dont really have a lot to compare it to) i had always been hesitant to try it because the curry smelled so strong and that line from anchorman always made me cringe (it smells like a babys diaper full of indian food)was i a ra-tard!my friends invited my man and i to a birthday gathering for a co-worker and were raving about this place the owners have come to visit us at my work on several occasions so i thought i could at least go and see what it was all about i knew it was going to be good because it was the only business left in the building (its located inside the hawaiian marketplace building by polo towers) and there were a ton of indian people there (always a good sign)alex was our server he was very friendly and we left our dinner in his handswhat a smart decision he brought out an amazing prix fixe menu i think of his own creation (nice touch) now i will do my best to at least describe my favorites:1) little fried dough balls with peas and potatoes insideserved with a mint cilantro and some sort of sweet/spicy glaze (tandoori sauce?)2) chicken tandoorigreat flavor sweet/spicy and bbqd to perfection3) lollipop lamb chops with some sort of glaze with a kick (great with the mint cilantro and sweet/spicy sauce mixed together)4) chicken tikka masalaholy cow! you must get this dish the curry is mild its creamy and a little bit of heaven in a dish 5) garlic nangarlic flat bread which was perfect for dipping in the chicken tikka masalai was so happy when we left my man and i actually went back the following evening because i was craving it again just as good the second time and we actually got alex as our server againhe remembered us from the night before (another nice touch) will be back again soon boyfriend and i were in las vegas for a small getaway staying a little off the strip was nice however getting food is always a pain in the ass due to constant tourist everywhere we decided we should try somewhere close that preferably wouldnt have very many tourists bring in tamba we made a reservation thinking the place would be jam packed however it was not we were seated immediately not having to wait at all because the place wasnt crowded at all their chicken tikka masala was amazingly good this is one of my favorite dishes so i enjoy when i go to an indian place that really makes it the way i like it their naan was also delicious we got the garlic naan as well as the alu naan which was also very good id definitely go here again if i am in the area it is somewhat off the beaten path i dont think the tourist have really found this gem of a restaurant after many visits saying gee we should try tamba we finally did!we visted on a sunday night and found the place to be nearly full and almost everyone was indian - always a good sign that the food is pretty authentic!they had two different feasts so we got one of each    both gave us a good sampling of what tamba has to offer   since we shared it meant just a taste of each item but all were very good      the vegetarian version of the feast started with samosas followed by saag paneer dal and a korma - not sure of the name along with really good naan    the meat version started with an awesome tandoori chicken followed by rogan josh chicken tikka masala and dal     all really good!service was good   i saw someone posted they did not have a/c - the night we went there were no issues with temperature so thats likely just a one time issue do you know how hard it is to find vegetarian food in vegas??? i didnt think it would be that difficult but turns out all people want to eat when they gamble is crab legs and steak! after walking forever and searching endlessly on yelp finally we found vegetarian food! they have some meat items like chicken tikka masala but tons of veg options (at least in the lunch buffet)the idly are fluffy and the sambar is very good the paneer was mostly missing in action and not very good when it was to be found but the halwa was delicious!!given that it was lunchtime im shocked that this place wasnt more crowded in fact there were only a couple other patrons there (they are kind of tucked away) cheapest buffet ever! it was small but only like $13 and had many good optionsto find it- just follow the signs and theyll lead you into some weird sliding glass doors of a deserted looking building then go up some escalators and youre there! we had a really lovely experience!  the ambiance is tasteful and our service was very friendly and helpful  he politely explained the items on the menu since we proved to be indian food dummies  tamba does not open until 6:00  parking can be a bit confusing  there is a lot behind mcdoanldsthere is a booth with a parking attendantsays $5  we told them we had a dinner reservation at tamba and he let us right in  no $5 necessarywe tried the cheese appetizer served with spicy mint sauce tamarind sauce and crackers  it was really good!  we had lamb korma chicken tikka masala eggplant 2 types of naan and basmati rice  the sauces on the chicken and lamb were excellent but the meat was dry in both  the eggplant was out of this world  everything had great flavor  i would definitely go back and im recommending it to all  we spent $100 for 4 with all the aforementioned and 2 large beers we had great food and service from anand   he had great recommendations and was thoughtful about the timing of everything we ordered a chicken tikka korma and the aloo gobi both were delicious and one of them was off the menu the tamarind sauce was great ambiance was good - the entrance to the mall is off putting but once inside its very comfortable dont let the location distract you this is a real gem! we had the chicken tikka masala and the butter chicken both were great!the mango lassi was very tasty tooi would strongly recommend you leave the standard food on the strip and enjoy this place! our friends were feeling indian so we came here to this indian restaurant this is located in the hawaiian marketplace between the mgm and planet hollywood filled with many vendors and eateries so it may be hard to find going inside the building where this restaurant is located was kind of creepy because it was super empty! however going inside the restaurant we saw multiple patrons enjoying their food and the atmosphere proved to be very cool and modern i shared an order of malai kofta and chicken tikka masala with my bf because we were hungry but not super hungry? hahaha what does that mean i dont get myself anyways both items were really good my boyfriend and i gobbled both of them up! portions were pretty big compared to other indian restaurants ive been to also their bowls are pretty cool (they were shaped like a spoon? you have to see it i cant really explain the weird shape right now) but need to be handled to great care as you can easily spill whatever item on your pants (like my boyfriend on his favorite khakis rip favorite khakis)waiters here were pretty friendly cool and funny what i liked was that they kept filling up my water! its like they know me they know i need to quench my thirstoverall a good time having indian food here in vegas! i definitely would come here again for some indian food enjoy! tucked away on the strip in the hawaiian marketplace area this is a hidden gem  so ill admit it was my first time having indian food  luckily i was meeting friends who had some knowledge about it and helped me out on what to have  we went family style so we were able to taste a little bit of everything we ordered  first i want to say the service and staff here were amazing  my water glass never went less than half full  kudos! our waiter was very helpful also in helping us decide what to get  i would say he went above and beyond! to start off we tried the vegetable samosas and vegetable pakoras  the samosas reminded me of an empanada except stuffed with potato and peas  accompanied with the sauces these were great! the pakoras were good also but a little too much breading  for the main course we went with the chicken tikka masala  the tomato curry sauce over the chicken was good! i scooped this over the basmati rice and was very pleased   as for the chicken and rice dishes there was plenty to be shared between 3 people and couldnt imagine eating this all myself we even had much leftover! the garlic naan came out warm flavorful and perfect  overall i was delighted for this to be my first indian food experience,4.0,18
Taj Palace,to be perfectly honest i was slightly disappointed call me obsessed but i came in fully expecting to see murgh makhani in one of the lunch buffet trays unfortunately all i saw was its boring cousin - chicken tikka masalaon the bright side the absence of my favorite dish caused me to try a lot more than i usually do i was happy to see goat curry and it was pretty good the other dish that stood out for me was the mutter paneer i didnt care for the cheese but i enjoyed the peas and the curry was a decent dipping sauce for the garlic naan (this is where murgh makhani excels imho)incidentally i did see murgh makhani on the menu so they definitely serve it i just wish it was in the lunch buffet like at namaste for that silly reason i give the edge to namaste but taj palace is still a-ok personally its the best indian food i have ever experienced my friend whom i dined with lived in london when she was younger and enjoyed a lot of fantastic indian food while she was there she also quite enjoyed it we had veggie samosa and chile naan with chicken tikka marsala the staff was really accommodating and were very helpful i will say that we ordered medium heat and it was almost too hot at times we agreed to level 5 heat loved it but will probably go with 4 or 3 next timelol anyhow we will be back for the lunch buffet seven days a week 11-3 taj palace has a lunch buffet for $999  located in the the shopping center on eastern and richmar this new indian restaurant is rich in decor and cuisine the hand painted tapestry style wall mural lantern style light fixtures and open lighting gives a bright look that most indian places lack the service was the best i have had in a long time as we sat ourselves the waiter came over to ask what kind of naan we would like and filled our water glasses throughout the meal our dirty plates never stayed on the table for more than 5 minutes if even that long water glasses were promptly refilled at the half way mark as well the food was consistent i found that i did not hate anything but the tandoori chicken was dry the garlic naan is amazing when brought out it was piping hot and topped with a copious amount of garlic the line had two different kinds of rice; basmati and a vegetable biryani they also had somosas that were tasty the saag (spinach) here was delicious but did not have the paneer (handmade cheese) the other non-meat dish i really liked was the veggies in the yellow curry for those who love their meat do not fret because taj palace offer some dishes for the carnivores as well the chicken tikka masala was creamy and possessed a deep rich flavor the goat curry was tender and not gameydo not forget to get a bowl of the kheer (rice pudding) before leaving taj palaces version is not too sweet and has cashews for a nice crunch it was the perfect end to a great meal decided to try this place due to a restaurantcom gift certificate and we are completely glad we didwe ordered the tandoori jhinga (shrimp) chicken tikka masala one regular naan one garlic naan and a mango lassieverything was great! chicken tikka masala was spiced just right (i think we couldve handled a bit more spiciness) and shrimp tandoori was yummy garlic naan was a bit overcooked so we ordered a regular naan which was just right the restaurant itself is in a great location spacious with nice ambience overall im glad theres an indian restaurant in the silverado area definitely worth a repeat visit :) last night in his work-induced coma on his only night off in ages my husband mumbled something about dinner what are you hungry for?  what have we not eaten in ages?  and then he answered his own question - indian   i remembered seeing positive reviews of a place on eastern and found it on my yelp app so off we went  we entered with a bit of hesitation as the restaurant was empty with the exception of two diners after waiting for what seemed forever he acknowledged us and invited us to be seatedi recognized him but couldnt place his face  maybe it was because he handed us menus while talking on a cordless phone and giving the other customers their checkmulti-tasking  not good for an initial restaurant impressionthe husband began to eyeroll mebut he became more forgiving as the server helped him through the enormous menu -- and we as usual overordered vegetable samosas chili pakorastandoori chickenchicken tikka masalamango chickenshrimp tikkadalsaag with potatoeszeera riceraitachili garlic naannot to mention the complimentary pappadums and chutneys and chilisstop it!   yes enough food for daysmy concerns that this would be steam table fare were put to rest once things began to arrive on the table    favorite dishes:  the vegetable samosas were incredibly flavorful and delicious  mango chicken (even better than the tikka)  the two vegetable dishes yellow lentils and the spinach were very satisfying the rice simple and delicious and the garlic chili naan was spectacular particularly with the raita  all in all a very good mealoh and the server?  its jignesh the former manager / server of sai india curry -- our favorite little chaat house near unlv that zipped up unceremoniously a while back  beer (domestic only for now) and wine available  its a simple lovely space with good food and kind serviceand the owner is definitely yelp savvy - he encouraged us a to write a yelp review as he bid us adieu taj palace is located in an upscale strip mall and had been one of our go-to places for indian food their lunch buffet is $1095 and one of the better values in town their space has a bright and comfortable ambience they offer a wide selection of vegetarian and meat dishes some of which you dont typically see at other indian buffets i do wish they offered butter chicken instead of chicken tikka masala because dark meat is more tender and tasty than white meat they also include unlimited fresh-baked plain or garlic naan with your lunch for dessert they usually offer kheer (rice pudding) and sometimes they also have halva actually this is the first place i ever tried halva and it was deliciousservice is friendly and generally efficient on our last visit i was disappointed by how they handled an incident where i discovered that i was chewing on a small strip of plastic imbedded in their curry the staff initially denied it was plastic and said it was vegetable fiber once it became evident that it was indeed a piece of plastic he said omg grabbed it and ran back into the kitchen they never apologized or offered us any dispensation nor did we ask for any i really enjoy this place its very close to my boyfriends house so we always come here the chicken tikka masala is very good and the goat curry is great!! the servers are very friendly and treat customers very well it is worth tryingupdate: their lunch buffet has been getting better and better by the day!!!! this place is great!! i had their lunch buffet and i went home fully satisfiedwe ordered garlic naan and got food from the buffet line chicken tikka masala was  really good! it was tender and the sauce was delicious! my favorite way to eat naan is to dip it in curry or dipping it in one of the dishes  i devoured three baskets of garlic naan in no time their curry was excellent as well great place to satisfy your indian appetite! im getting hungry just talking about this place as a long time orange county kid and the son of indian immigrants  i have a pretty good understanding of quality south asian cuisine ive eaten a lot of it from restaurants and ive had it countless times in home cooked meals trust me then when i say that this place is really just okits well decorated and the service was alright we came here for a lunch buffet one time i did find the garlic naan to be pretty tasty but in the realm of indian cuisine this establishment hardly impresses its hard for me to put into words exactly but the flavor texture and quality of the ingredients were simply below what i expect from an indian place some of the curries were a bit bland i wasnt particularly impressed by their chicken tikka the lentils here are are a bit overcooked and again just not that good dont get me wrong-- its passable and worth trying i think its a good place to go to for lunch-- indian food isnt something most people eat everyday but if you want quality south asian food there are much better places even here in vegas try the hole in the wall kabob corner in fremont it may not look impressive but their food tastes much fresher and is much better seasoned this was my first foray into indian food and i found it using yelp  the staff was friendly and helpful explaining what each item was on the buffet  i tried a taste of everything and found the chicken tikka masala and chicken tandoori amazing  i scooped it up with delicious garlic naan  i usually love curry but didnt care for the goat curry  nor did i like the vegetarian dishes with spinich or lentils  i chkd the menu prices as well and the buffet is an excellent deal  ill be going back there soon not the worst indian restaurant in las vegas but absolutely not deserving of a 45 yelp rating when we visited the buffet was uninspired featured no paneer option and was severely lacking in spice and overall layers of flavour it felt geared toward middle americas palate rather than those of expats from the sub-continent and those of us with a bit of experience in the true heavenly flavours of the region give me a good curry and some tasty naan to mop up the sauce and i am happy sadly taj palace presented my usual go to dish the chicken tikka masala as a disappointinging bland rather sweet and lacking any real zest and the naan was almost tastelessthe food looked ok but this is the sort of indian a grandparent would eat ill stick to mint or mt everest we were craving indian food but didnt feel like driving so we stopped by this place we had their lunch buffet before but wasnt overly impressed we figured the dinner would be better i ordered the chicken tikka masala with 7 spiciness out of 10 and it was pretty hot they used white meat but some pieces were very dry and some were moist she ordered a combination plate coming from ny and boston indian food always comes with rice but they charge you here we also ordered a nan and roti which was pretty goodthis place wasnt horrible but i probably wont go back to this location and would probably drive a little further for better indian food6/10 this place was okay my fiance and i were seriously craving indian food and this place was near our housethe portions are good you get a good amount of food for what you pay forwe shared the chicken tikka masalait looked yummy the first bite was really good but as i kept eating i noticed some pieces of chicken tasted oldthe naan was good but nothing specialhonestly i would not return here again ive had better indian food for cheaper as far as indian food goes taj palace is delicious as far as service? our waiter vimal treated us like queens its the typical strip-mall exterior like almost all restaurants in henderson nv coming from los angeles im starting to get used to great restaurants like this - after all many wonderful treasures can be found in strip-mall style buildings in lawhen we were seated around 8:30 pm the entire restaurant was empty so there was no wait vimal brought out papadum (indian bread crispy and very thin like a cracker) with hot green sauce and a tasty plum sauce we ordered veggie samosas to start which seemed to be hand-made at the restaurant and were spectacular vimal convinced us to try nasi biryani rice instead of the traditional white basmati rice i normally order its like an indian fried rice with golden raisins and almonds that has a yellow coloring from the spices delicious that came out with our chicken tikka masala in medium spiciness and our garlic naan every dish was better than the last at this point a middle-aged couple came into the nicely decorated restaurant and sat down to dinner as well i think its surprising that the place was so empty considering how yummy everything was the other couple verbally recognized this and asked vimal about it as well it seems new ownership took over more than a year ago and he just needs to get the word out so heres the word - well be stopping by again soon to check out the buffet for lunch that seems like a great value! now i love indian food and basically will order it every where i travel to because i always get a craving for it  i had been thinking about taj palace for some time now and finally got the family to try it outa  ambiance - strip mall setting plenty of seating arrangements and for various size perhaps you can fit up to about 85 people so it was decent size  good lighting nice bar buffet area tables and booths  i say 4 starb  service - it was not busy so we got pretty darn good service from everyone there although it seemed to take like forever for the food to come out and the natives were getting a bit restless  4 starc  food -3 stara  chicken tikka marsala - ok so this is really an english invented indian dish and not popular in india  i get it just like chop suey and fortune cookies in chinese cooking these were things invented not in the original country  i get it  but man was this dish uninspired!!!!!!!  the chicken was cut in huge cubes  the best way to slice is to take the breasts and cut at angles to get thin against the grain meat that when cooked produce an aromatic and tender chicken  eating these chunks was like eating chunks  we asked for 2 out of 10 spice due to the kids and this thing was more spicy than the 5/10 spice i ordered for the lamb  2 starb  lamb bhuna - i was a looking for the lamb roghan josh  the spice was mild perhaps they messed this up with the miles tikka i ordered?  the lamb was a bit tough however the gravy sauce was awesome and quite tasty  i give this a 3 star  great taste terrible texturec  garlic naan - kids loved it we had to order another servicing  4 stard tandoori chicken - hmmm good color bit dry on a bed of peppers very tasty if not overly cooked  2 starto me a family of four and it cost about 8500 including tip way too expensive and not enough to warrant a return visit  1 star for a lunch buffet priced at $1000 with killer garlic naan and the best service i have seen at an indian place this place gets 4 stars automatically  the food?  well it was simply wonderful and amazing and delish and oh so perfect  i came here solo for lunch two days ago for the first time and found the place to be a hidden gem (to me maybe not to others)  im sure the options might change daily for the buffet but the first two things i tried were the only two things i ate - because they were that good  the lentils with rice and the chicken tikka masala - cant go wrong  for some reason i just wasnt in the mood for lamb but it looked very good  this place is good and you cant beat the lunch buffet price and food! it is a well decorated charming indian restaurant in the middle of a strip mall on eastern parking can be a hassle on the weekends for dinner due to it being located next to overly popular and equally overrated bjsthe service is always incredible the servers are friendly accommodating and extremely willing to make suggestions to get you out of the chicken tikka masala comfort zone for dinner boyfriend had spicy vindalo ($15) which is chicken cooked with potatoes spices and vindaloo sauce which is the red variety of sauce it was not very spicy as i believe they modified it due to fear of us not being able to handle the heat i love my food spicy the dish was good neverthelessi had the spicy haryali ($16) which was chicken cooked in spicy green sauce made with onion spinach mint cilantro and green chili once again it was very delicious but not spicy we ordered side of gralic naan ($350) and it was very goodalso the server suggested we get peas pilau ($7) which was basmati rice seasoned with peas nuts and raisins i didnt care for the raisins and probably would opt for just regular basmati rice next time we also shared an indian variety of beer based on the servers suggestion it was good and quite large ($8)all in all the food was good and the portions generousbut the total did leave a bit of a sticker shock i think id opt for the lunch buffet and try to sample more of their dishes  the service as i mentioned before was superb  i would recommend this place if you are in the area and craving quality indian food and great service yum!1 star = customer service was awesome  they really helped me out as it was my very first time really eating indian food  my friend is also on a vegan diet and they helped him pick the foods he can eat  extremely helpful!2 stars = for the environment!  handcrafted art and tapestry walls surround you in the restaurant and it feels kind of intimate and romantic!3 stars = garlic naan  dont leave this place w/ out trying it especially if youre into bread and garlic like i am  it is so tasty i finished the entire basket myself!4 stars = chicken tikka masala!  yum! buttery curry and mildly spicy over a bed of their rice; so good!  5 stars = fried okra!  my friend ordered spicy so it was a lot to handle but the veggies went really well to compliment my chickencoming back for sure! this place is in the same plaza as bjs and it is fairly easy to find if you use the turning lane in the middle of the block i arrived here with some friends on friday afternoon shortly after lunch hour it wasnt too crowded and they got put tables together to accommodate us sufficiently we went straight for the buffet without even thinking about the menu although its pretty easy to justify eating the lunch buffet here when you do look at the entree pricesthe buffet table nearest to the clean plates is clearly all vegetarian items and the next table has meat dishes a small salad bar and desserts all the items are clearly labeled by name and with ingredients while i dont remember all the names offhand i loved the chicken korma really enjoyed the vegetable samosas and chicken tikka masala also liked the tandoori chicken and saag (spinach) and generally had no issue with other dishes except for the goat curry that thing does not taste like goat or like any particular meat also your choice of butter or garlic naan is brought out from the kitchen to your tablealthough ive only been to two lunch buffets at indian restaurants i feel that theres enough good food here to grant this place five stars with of course some consideration that buffet food is generally not on par with a la carte courses check it out whether you like indian food or whether you just want a change of pace decided to be adventurous and came here because of the rating the service was excellent and attentive at all the right times  food presentation was nice  chicken tikka masala and naan were excellent  we tried 3 dishes with naan and drinks spent over $100 will be coming back i have never tried indian food before so i was excited when my friend and i walked in at first we thought it was dead but when we came inside there was actually a lot of people the service was great!! they are very attentive and very helpful i ordered the chicken tikka masala and my friend ordered the lamb mango curry both dishes was delicious  have to order the peas pillau and the garlic naan and their mango lasse was very refreshing my friend and i loves to eat and try new places since this was my first time trying indian food i would definitely let my friends know about this place and i would come back to try more of their dishes after recently relocating to las vegas i decided it was time to scout out a place to turn to when im experiencing a craving for indian food  i wouldnt say im an expert but i spend most of my dining-out experiences in indian restaurants and this time i wasnt too impressed***disclaimer: i have left behind the perfect indian restaurant where i recently moved from and i know nothing will ever compare***we ordered paneer pakoras chicken tikka masala (spice level 7) and chicken curry (spice level 5)  the paneer pakoras were fresh and fluffy but lacked flavor or spice  the sauce for the tikka masala was okay but no amount of creamyness or richness would save the dry chunks of chicken  the spice level was pretty good but if you like spicy indian food you better order something higher than a 5 because a 5 is the equivalent of mild (in my opinion)  the curry was tender but just okay  nothing much to report on thatmy biggest problem with this place is the price  the naan and rice are an additional $850 not to mention the fact that each entree item is about $15 a piece  yes you get a lot of food but thats standard at any indian restaurant  the naan is nothing exceptional either  our total bill came out to $45 which is crazy!  with as many places las vegas has to offer me i wont be returning  the staff is nice though! id like to amend my review a little now that ive been back so many timesive tried the lunch buffet twice in two days im officially hooked!the service is pretty attentive vimil (vick) is very friendly he makes an extra effort to remember his customers and takes pride in his job hes remembered my name ever since i paid with a credit card him and other staff always keep my water glass quite full a definite necessity in an indian restaurant we got there by about 2pm and the lunch buffet closes at 3pm at exactly 3:06pm the server came over and informed us that they were closed and it was time for us to go i thought this was a little abrupt but we were mostly finished so we lefti really like the varied options depending on the day the samosas were really good filled with spicy potato these were a little spicy but very tasty i poured a little bit of mint chutney over the top and it was perfect i actually wished they would have had them the second day i also really liked the chicken tikka masala because i love the red sauce that it comes in perfect for dipping naan there was also a white cream based chicken dish that was really tender on my first visit i didnt have room to try the tandoori chicken on the bone but on my 2nd visit there was tandoori chicken pieces and they were pretty tender i like my stuff super saucy so i dipped my tandoori chicken in the raita (spiced yogurt) and it was delicious garlic naan is the way to go i love me some garlic!! the naan has came out piping hot super fresh on every visit also on my first trip i brought my vegan friend and she had a lot of options to choose from and was very happy with the selections i would definitely recommend telling the server if you are vegan because one of the labels above the food was inaccurate for my second visit i brought two indian food experts they both agreed that it was a pretty good buffet especially for the price they seemed to enjoy the food but one of them felt that the dishes could have used a little more spices both of them agreed they would rather have the dishes spicier but realize that with a buffet its usually going to be mild to medium  i would definitely like to come back during dinner and try some of the menu items although i think ill have a hard time staying away from this buffet i love having tons of options and you cant beat the price about $11 per person ordered take out last night and it was surprisingly fresh and good! the chicken tikka masala aloo gobi and mushroom mattar all tasted authentic the samosas and naan were excellent! best indian lunch buffett in las vegas the food quality is consistent the staff is friendly affordable priced you cant go wrong if you like indian foodthe garlic naan is outstanding and the chicken tikka masala is the best i ever hadtry it! came here for dinner with a bunch of friends and got seated right away since it wasnt busy at all the ambiance is nice and relaxing there was some incense burning and although the smell wasnt really all that pleasant i got over it eventually and didnt think much of itfor our dinner outing i opted for the paneer tikka masala paired up with some garlic naan the food was alright but nothing to write home about i thought the tikka masala lacked flavor and the naan was a bit dry in comparison to what i am used to at other places other people in my party ordered the chicken tikka masala and i decided to get in on it just to see if there was any difference in flavor between the two surprisingly there was not oh well i came to get fed and that happened so i guess im good haha luckily someone in our group had a coupon to take off some of the damage from the billnot bad but not enticed to come here on a regular/semi-regular basis id probably give it another chance but might expand to other options on the menu instead of my usual indian comfort dinner dish well see the chicken tikka masala is to die for the servers are very efficient and nice right when you sit down they bring over water indian chips and two sides to dip the chips in the green one is pretty spicy be aware! the red one isnt as spicy but so great today we had the spiciness a 5 which was almost a little too spicy for me but still good i havent tried the buffet but will soon for sure i highly recommend this place! the atmosphere is nice and welcoming and ive never had to wait for a table after a hike yesterday we stopped here for their lunch buffet  it was almost empty when we arrived but we must have been a draw because business picked up while we were therethey brought us ice water and we ordered garlic naan  in fact we ordered a second basket of garlic naan before we even started with the first  it was quite goodthe first part of the buffet had all vegetarian dishes  some of the standouts here were the  pakoras large triangles filled with a spicy mix of vegetables and the saag  the saag had excellent flavorings and was very tasty  i also tried some of the lentils and they were also goodin the second section i had some goat curry chicken tikka masala and tandoori chicken  the chicken tikka masala was standard as was the goat curry  the tandoori chicken was a bit drya couple of things i noted that were different  there is no silverware on the table  you pick up utensils at the buffet when youre there or you go back and get if you forget  i was expecting some kind of mtv india music playing or video  but they had their tv off which was quite ok  but instead we had pop music which just didnt seem to fit the placethe room is pleasant service was ok and the lunch buffet was good  there are a few standout items as mentioned  i didnt have dessert not even kheer which almost unheard of for me  the naan filled me up quite nicely along with two plates of food i love this little restaurant! everything on the menu is delicious and the service is always great their butter chicken is amazing and the lentil soup has really intricate flavors - absolutely delicious i also love their chicken tikka and tikka masala - you really cant go wrong with any dish here! and dont forget e garlic naan :),3.9310344827586206,29
Samosa Factory,im from central new jersey otherwise known as mumbai west where authentic indian restaurants are three-deep in every single strip mall  indian food is my favorite ethnic cuisine so i know good indian when i eat it  and samosa factory is that good!this was our first visit and its now our new favorite vegas indian restaurant  the food was terrific the service outstanding and the waitress katie was friendly helpful and attentive  just as important we were made to feel welcome by her as well as by the ownerwe started with veggie samosas  i love them but dont often order them because theyre usually heavy and greasy  not here  the pastry covering was light and flaky the filling was fresh and delicious and it was one helluva stuffed samosa  the accompanying coriander sauce was the best ive ever had and the chutney had a deliciously different tastewe had chicken tikka which was cut in bite-sized pieces and mixed with green and yellow peppers onions and an assortment of flavorful spices  the dish was brimming with flavor and happily it didnt have the overwhelming heaviness that i always dread at indian restaurants  my nit with this dish is that we were sharing it so presenting it on a small flat plate made it a bit difficult to transfer to our own plates we also shared a chicken & spinach curry  i hesitated before ordering it expecting the spinach to be drowning in cream and ghee  it wasnt  and the cubes of chicken were the most tender ive ever hadthe onion nan had an abundance of onion and again was lighter and less greasy than i expected  we also ordered a side of raita  i was intrigued by the description which said that the yogurt was mixed with granny smith apple  hmm different  and it was; the apple added a slight sweetness and was the perfect complement to the tanginess of the yogurt  it was the outstanding accompaniment for the chicken tikka  the mango lassi was great too  (be aware that the restaurant has no liquor license  but if you must drink you can get sloshed before or after at pts pub a few doors down  i suspect kristin b did just that before writing her ridiculous non-review)the entrees were served with rice; the menu had the word pilaf blacked out and the rice was plain white rice  this was a first for me and it didnt make me ecstatic:  i missed the grilled onion and great flavor that a good rice pilaf - with basmati rice - should have  but this is a small price to pay for a wonderful dinner that will otherwise please your palate and not make you feel as if your fat and calorie quota has exceeded the national debt  all in all this was a memorable meal and one that we look forward to repeating very soon the bad news: i was in las vegas the good news: i wasnt on the strip the bad news: the temperature at our hotel near the strip was averaging 106 degrees the good news: it was somewhat cooler at red rock canyon the bad news: we were hungry and had about a thousand miles of suburbs between us and that indian restaurant i was meaning to try id seen advertised at every bus stop in town the good news: we never made it to that placeokay enough newsabout halfway (or more) back to the strip from red rock canyon my stomach stopped grumbling and started screaming at me to eat now! whenever my stomach gets louder than the voices in my head i start to get worried i was scanning the restaurantscape through las vegas suburbs for anything that wouldnt have gluten in it (hi there in case we havent been introduced im silly ack i dont eat gluten) continuing down charleston i considered my options kfcnope ihopnope vinope ddnope dqum maybe after dinner nobody in the suburbs has time for restaurants with actual names anymore we only get initials nowi dodged (or in my case toyotaed) south to sahara and continued east figuring mr stomach would just have to wait till we got to that indian place across town note to celiacs indian places are notorious for not having gluten in most of their entrees not to mention indian food in generals pretty damn yummy anyway just ask your waiter for gluten-free options if the restaurant gets it theyll be very helpful if you get a dumb look instead of helpfulness back away slowly the restaurants actually cooking their food fresh and not getting spice mixes and prepackaged ingredients will point out all the entrees without gluten and point you away from things like breads and samosasdid i just see the word samosa? that sounds indian! i skidded my rental car around a full one eighty and hammered it back to samosa factory thanks hertz! like its on rails forget about that other indian place this looks like an indian restaurant and its right here in front of us which makes it the best indian place in town!there was no buffet an immediate brownie point for the factory i respect a place that makes me order from a menu so they can cook it up fresh i was already ignoring the menus samosas even before our helpful waiter told me to avoid the samosas along with the other gluten ruined food its a bummer not being able to try their namsake kind of like being a vegeterian in a steak house but i probably wouldnt have gotten samosas anyway so there instead we got chicken tikka masala aloo gobi and okra i think some places call the okra dish bhindi masala which sounds like its got a lot more to it than just okra sfs (samosa factory not san francisco) okras got a lot more to it than just okra so to avoid confusion ill call it okra (bhindi masala) or since were in the suburbs sfs (sf n sf) o (bm)our entrees were mind blowingly tasty spiced about as medium as wed hedged on when ordering them whether you want no spice or burn your face off hot theyll oblige just be specific when you order the only problem was that there was not enough rice so the end of each entree ended up flying solo on our plates a rather soupy saucy solo as an encore we had kheer which is rice pudding i guess we still had rice on our minds after not getting enough rice with dinner it was good but i have to admit after having kheer at punjab (a sf (not sf but sf) restaurant where they load their kheer up with huge amounts of cardamom pistachio and almonds) i found it a little bland like rice pudding admittedly samosa factorys kheer is probably how proper kheer should taste so ill shut up (psst hey chef at sf (not sf)try the kheer at punjab next time youre in sf (not sf)) the good thing is after all that great indian food for dinner and dessert there was no more stomach screaming and it was in no way necessary for us to turn back west toward dqwe did however venture back out to samosa factory the next afternoon just to make sure it was really as good as we thought it was it wasi have been to vegeterian indian restaurants (reader meet my review of masalaa my review of masalaa this is my new friend reader) and have been to many omnivore indian restaurants all of which had vegeterian sections on their menus (because theres a lot of vegetables in india silly) but ive never been to an indian restaurant that seperated their vegeterian section into vegeterian and vegan sections pretty smart and cutting edge i think these guys are on the technological forefront of us style (not us but oh never mind!) indian dining be on the lookout for them to launch a fast-casual version of this restaurant in hundreds of cities by the end of q4 (thats the fourth quarter for those of you not familiar with betting on football at the office)if not you didnt hear it here first-silly ack one of the best indian restaurants in town!  they do serve the best rice pudding  reasonable prices  i usually order the chicken tikka masala or the lamb korma  great quality food  their sauces are rich and creamy  i think each entree is good for 2 people (depending on how hungry you are but ive always been stuffed sharing an entree)  small restaurant but great service i cant really compare their samosas to the rest of the worlds so im giving them the benefit of the doubt i tried the vegetarian and the lamb i ended up preferring the vegetarian; though i love lamb i found the fluffy potatoes and the bite of the peas inside the crunchy shell really enjoyable the lamb samosa seemed a bit dry and flavorlessi ordered the chicken tikka masala to use as a standard of measure ive had several versions by now and enjoyed most of them a bit more than this i felt that this one was pretty mediocre with big tough chunks of chicken in a lot of runny sauce the amount of rice they give is a single bowlful per entree which is ok if its one person but wouldnt be enough to feed both my boyfriend and i im not sure if they charge for the additional portions of rice but it would be worth asking if you order more also i like spicy food a lot! i initially ordered the extra hot version of the dish which the server assured me would be extremely hot face melting-ly so i eventually backed down to just the hot i ended up being very disappointed by the overall heat level the other diner in the party who ordered a hot dish agreed in that her dish wasnt particularly spicy either the overall flavor wasnt too impactful- initially it had a nice creeper heat but it hit a mid-note and then mellowed out there were a few pieces of fresh herbs floating about in the orange sauce which is a nice touch their rice had a good texture i like that they have clearly marked and distinguished menus for vegetarians and vegans id be willing to give them another chance if someone wanted us to go but theyre out of my way and didnt particularly impress me the first time around i liked that their iced chai tea was served without milk or creamer making it a lot lighter and more refreshing id never had it straight like that and it was nice another diner tried the mango lassi and didnt like it it was then offered on to any willing participants and eventually found its way into a garbage can several miles away and melted 5 stars  the complaints about the food being bland are valid but only because they cook all the food mild be default it says in the menu to ask for spicy if you like some kick  i can understand this but didnt see the section in the menu mentioning it so we got our food mild and it was certainly mild!  great food though very light not heavy like most indian restaurants and coming from an indian family i know my indian food well  looking forward to going again and asking for some kick had:veggie samosas (good chutneys)papadum (also good)chai (excellent!!!!)saag paneer (very good pretty sure the paneer was fresh also and not the indian grocery store verka/dhawat/nanak prepakaged)chicken tikka masala (good needs kick though there was no tikkaskipped desert was too fulltotal cost was under 50 bucks with tip/tax will definately go again! amazing place! i love that feeling of a family owned business off the strip and not a franchise the owner richard  is amazing he is very interactive with the customer and remembered my friends order from last time he was there that just shows you how amazingly attentive he is we ordered the chicken tikka masala lamb spinach shrimp curry and tons of their garlic naan i also ordered their mango lassi for my drink and it was just amazing! i could not stop drinking it! if you like indian food this is a great great great place to try out they also have a vegan menu too!!!! ive had my eye on samosa factory for some time but finally got around to trying it last night when our first choice for dinner was closed for the holiday we entered the small dining area and were greeted by the incredibly friendly server we told him we wanted to order our food to-go and he still offered us two glasses of water and a starter to nibble on while we perused the menu we settled on the lamb vindaloo and the chicken tikka masala we also ordered some garlic naan our server was incredibly personable and offered us refills on our water while we waited as well as made some idle chit chat with us once our food arrived we paid our bill and off we went with our food the server also offered us a to-go menu for our return visit great customer service!my fella and i dug into our meal as soon as we got home the spice level was just right we ordered the medium spice level to be on the safe side on our first visit the garlic naan was delicious and i really enjoyed the rice the flavors were right on and i look forward to a return visit to hopefully eat in the restaurant and try some of their samosas the food is not cheap but i didnt feel it was overly expensive for the quantity and quality of food we gotdefinitely a great indian option in a town that is lacking great food great service chicken tikka was awesome with fresh peppers iced tea had a surprising and refreshingly different flavor yelp you disappointed me tonight you know if the restaurant is run by people whose ethnic background does not match the food something is bound to go wrong (sorry just a stereotype of mine i cannot break)anyways we decided on indian for dinner tonight and i suggested to try samosa factory as i had bookmarked this place for quite some time the restaurant had mostly positive reviews which is what convinced me to stray from our usual indian jointthe restaurant itself is small definitely a hole in the wall type of place  we were greeted by this a large caucasian man definitely not what i was expecting at an indian restaurant  not sure if he was the owner but in addition to seating us he took our order and served us our mealwe order the chicken tikka masala shrimp vindaloo and garlic naan  both entrees served with basmati ricethe chicken tikka masala was not what we were expecting  prepared completely different from any other indian restaurant weve ever tried  i was expecting yummy curry sauce but this hardly had any  although it wasnt badly prepared it just wasnt up to our liking  the shrimp vindaloo was nothing spectacular either  this had more curry sauce than the chicken tikka masala but nothing impressive  i like curry sauce to be thick this was more watery  lastly the garlic naan and basmati rice were just average  i didnt care of the naan because it was thin and dry as opposed to thick and fluffy like how we are used to having at mt everestsigghh what a disappointing meal  sorry to say we wont be coming back my favorite place in all of las vegas! i only order 2 things so its hard to rate it all the veggie korma and spinach curry i love them both! the garlic naan is covered in garlic and cilantro its delish too my husband is not adventurous he orders the chicken tikka every time getting him to even go in was a huge effort now most days its his idea to eat here i also highly recommend iced chai tea! delicious!! my husband and i were in las vegas for a few days and purchased several groupons to try while in town samosa factory has become one of our favorite indian places we had a chicken samosa chicken tikka masala saag paneer and plain naan the chicken samosa was packed with flavor and very fresh! the chicken tikka masala was not as sweet as we liked but still fantastic the saag paneer was more saucy than other indian places; regardless we really liked the dish the service was absolutely fantastic and topped off the wonderful night id definitely recommend this place! went to the samosa factory with a dear friend for lunch she was greeted by the staff and we were ushered to her usual table by the window the server was courteous and attentive unfortunately the fare was not as commendablei ordered the lamb curry ($895) lunch special; a hot chai tea ($250); and vegetable chaat samosa ($695)the chaat arrived first a heaping plate of green chutney creamy yogurt and innumerable other colors and flavors the chaat was just okay try the chaat at mount everest down the road to see what real chaat should taste like the chai tea arrived after a big steaming cup with a dollop of curdled cream floating on top this was so disappointing it is impossible to find good chai in las vegas does not taste like indian chai teanext the lamb curry arrived with a heaping scoop of jasmine rice it was bland and unenjoyable my friend enjoyed her chicken tikka masala and naan i tried the naan and it was hot and fresh though a bit thin and crispythere are too many excellent indian food options in las vegas to return to samosa factory best indian food ever! its clean fresh and so flavorful!! in a little out of the way spot - totally unassuming had chicken tikka masala lamb vindaloo chicken korma roti samosas and chai all was unbelievable:) were so happy,4.0,13
Shalimar Restaurant,okay this restaurant is next to the salon i work at and i have to say i was hesitant to go in because of the way it looks its not dirty at all but its very plainfrom what ive been told they just opened this place earlier this year had the food and it was pretty darn good! i ordered the kabli channa chicken tikka masala and the naan bread yum yum yum the prices are totally affordable loves! im giving this place five stars for the food!  this is truly excellent pakistani cuisine  and the prices are great (for example several $595 veg entrees)  our party of four ordered chicken tikka masala that was spicy and had a thick gravy - we cleaned that up!  the dal masala was differently made than weve ever had in that the lentils were whole instead of pureed  it made a very nice texture plus the flavor was gooood!   we also ordered eggplant and a mixed veg dish - both had hearty chunks of vegetable and were nicely spiced  oh and the garlic naan was so hard to stop eating!   i think this is a family owned place but we didnt feel too much love from anyone  the decor of the place is really simple and drab too (but clean)  but if you just close your eyes and concentrate on the food i think youll be in masala heaven!  :) going to have to buck the yelp trend a bit here and rate this one 25 stars overallothers have commented about the lack of ambiance here and ill have to agree the restaurant is very plain and we went our tablecloth was a bit dirty and there was a vaguely unpleasant smell in the air the smell was probably just an unfortunate combination of spices and foods from the kitchen but this could really do with being closed off from the serving area not only to prevent a medley of odors but so the diner isnt deafened by clattering of pots and pans and so oni ordered chicken tikka masala garlic naan pappadums the basmati rice and water for my beverage  instead of the usual indian restaurant theme of refreshingly iced water topped up the second i sip from my glass i was surprised to be presented with a single bottle of kroger water which i had to sip sparingly lest i have to shell out another dollar for anotherthe pappadums were ok but unremarkable not unlike the pre-made ones you get from indian grocers and then stick in the microwave for 45 seconds instead of the usual bowls of mint or cilantro chutney and tamarind chutney these came accompanied by a couple of roadhouse diner style squeeze bottles filled with some sort of condiments both were extremely runny almost a water consistency one seemed to taste vaguely of tamarind and i couldnt identify the othermy garlic naan was the highlight of my meal and had that certain mix of denseness and crispness thats the hallmark of a good garlic naanthe rice was pretty good also cooked with saffron and ghee and very plentiful for just a couple of bucksthe main meal my chicken tikka masala was just ok - the chicken was of good quality and well cooked but the sauce lacked a certain deft touch and was a little aggressive as the spices didnt all blend together quite how i like id be very happy if i had cooked this up myself at home but its a notch below what i expect at a restaurantthe people running this place were very friendly but it was a rather odd experience at around 8pm we were the only people in the restaurant and it was a little strange and awkward having the guy sitting there in the tiny restaurant 15 feet from us while we ate one thing in shalimars favour is the prices - they are very decent we didnt hold back on breads and rice and things and our entire meal for two (including bottled water) came to just over $25this is the sort of place i could imagine myself coming to regularly for a cheap lunch if i worked in the area and was limited in where i could travel on my lunch break the food is good enough and cheap enough to eat again for a dinner out; however the atmosphere here is little above that of a food court and the food is only a few points above mediocre worth a look for the price but go in with low expectations really enjoy the spice value and portion here self-serve chai is always a plus have eaten there twice now and the same dishes were consistent and it is refreshing to see reasonably priced a-la-carte naan ($150) and rice ($295 for a very big mound on an oblong plate - enough for 2 persons) sidenote: pet peeve is when restaurants getcha on the sides that you depend on like rice miso soup etc some of the worst offenders in my experience have been china grill at mandalay bay ($7 bowl of white rice) gaylord india at rio ($7 plate of white rice) nobu matsuhisa locations ($5 for small cup of miso soup) olive garden ($4 for a side of marinara sauce to go with your free breadsticks) most of these getchas show up on your bill by surpriseback to the curry at hand: shalimar serves up quality cheap and generous vegetarian curries (the eggplant masala and mili juli(sp?) mixed vegetable curry and yellow dal are all top tier) and the chicken tikka masala is excellent as well we ordered everything medium-hot and it came out spicy but not stupid spicy spice is dialed in with experienced hands in the kitchen over at shalimar no flavors were ruined with too much spice here and the flavors are complex and different in every dish this is important because sometimes i swear that when we are at an unfamiliar indian restaurant and we order 4 different dishes they use the exact same curry base in 3 of them hoping we dont notice not the case here shalimar makes each dish with singular carefood is basically 5-stars in my book but the lack of ambiance (ie fluorescent lights) brings it down a star certainly not a first (or second) date kind of place instead you will see husbands and wives families and groups of friendswere going to sit in view of the kitchen next time so we can see the behind-the-scenes i really like eating here its a nice flavor change-up from our other favorite indian spots such as mint indian bistro namasté ranis world foods thali counter and the indian counter at the riviera food court warm-up note: both times weve had enough left over for lunch for two the next day upon opening the to-go box out of the fridge the curry has a healthy viscosity without any sign of ghee-ponding or crusting less ghee = less butter = ok to eat when craving very good quality food made fresh to order and extremely affordable    rather small inside but personal and laid back    the garlic naan and mango lessi were extremely good and we really enjoyed the biryani chicken tikka masala and bangab bharta (eggplant)    in the corner of a strip mall so it is a little hard to find but definitely worth the effort for authentic food at great prices i love indian food and was looking for it in vegas a friend suggested me of this wonderful placei loved the atmosphere there nice and clean place especially the kitchen the staff was so lovely and helpful my friends and i ordered chicken breast chicken biryani chicken tikka masala and okra we got our food exactly after 15 minutes the best indian food i ever ate in vegas the price was reasonable i highly recommend going there if you want to have a real authentic indian food  i couldnt tell if its spices or bathroom smells (or both!) but they could use some better ventilation here the restaurant is small and unassuming; decor/atmosphere simple and functionalhad the chicken tikka masala and goat karahi with rice of course the goat was overly tough by my standards but the sauce was alright the spices were clearly visible and had nice chunks of ginger in it the chicken tikka masala felt fairly standard with the chicken being on the dry sidebottom line: not the greatest but works in a jiff if youre super hungry oh if you order water theyll give you bottled water specify if you want (free) iced water my indian friend insisted on taking me and our mutual friend here for some authentic indian food for dinner one night  he ordered everything for us: goat biryani goat karahi chicken tikka masala naan and mango lassi (x3)  i personally do not enjoy eating goat because i find it to be too tough and at times gamey so i wasnt looking forward to our meal!  luckily i was pleasantly surprised by the goat karahi- it was tender and pretty tasty!  the chicken however was dry tough and the sauce was gritty  the biryani was just alright  this place is bone-in if that matters to you  sometimes i prefer places without because i just hate biting down on gristle or little pieces of bone but i know the bones add more flavor  also the naan was just eh  i love a good fluffly naan but this one was hard on one side and not so fluffy (not a great description but what counts is that it wasnt the same)this place is okay but i dont think ill go out of my way to visit again  maybe i cant handle authentic indian food haha  im still searching for the perfect indian restaurant in las vegas! i keep trying to convince myself that this place is appealing because sometimes the food is great but the current environs are grimy crusty and damn it - the bathroom is kind of gross just not a good dining experience get your food to go if you choose to eat it the energy in this place is depressing and the contractor-grade fluorescent lights only accentuate the details at nightsome dishes are excellent still: eggplant masala mili juli mixed vegetable curry yellow dal chicken tikka masala note: this is my cultural cuisine the food here is definitely the best and most authentic pakistani food in vegas and infact defiantly one of the best i have had in the us and i have been to all in socal dc northern virginia houston etc now the ambience is bad its a run down hole in the wall and can be construed as very depressing its irrelevant to me because im here for the food so the 5 star rating is for the food their chicken tikka is amazing! self serve chai is always a plus! very tasty food is served at this hole-on-the-wall if you like spicy theyll make it spicy!  my pain-in-the-arse whiter-than-white friend ordered a dish and when it came she didnt like the look of it the servers here took it back and made her something custom!  no charge for the returned dish my chicken tikka masala was just right and i love the rice they serve  the garlic nan is so huge 1 order is good for 2 people unlimited self-serve chai!!!! yum great prices authentic food casual place off the strip if you are looking for good indian food in vegas that is not pretentious this is definitely a great bet  the chicken tikka and nan are fantastic  i havent had a chance to try anything else yet but i will definitely be coming back and will update my review,3.9166666666666665,12
Maharani Restaurant,i crave indian food pretty regularly and im happy to know that there are a number of indian restaurants in madison to satisfy my cravingthe samosa vegetable pakora paneer (cheese) pakora are decent  however the aloo tikki (small spicy potato discs) is very tasty with the right amount of spicesi love parantha (layered whole wheat bread made with melted butter) and the maharani parantha here are delicious and remind me of when i used to make these with mom  you have to eat them right when they come out though because thats when theyre the best - hot buttery crispy and tender  the roti naan is pretty good too  made exactly the way naan is (baked in a tandoor oven) except they use whole wheat flour instead of white flour  the chicken tikka masala is delectable  the sauce is orange colored rich creamy and has nice chunks of boneless chicken (could use more chunks of chicken)  this is also spiced really nicely  you get a choice of mild medium or hot for the level of spiciness in your dishes  medium here is really good - it teeters on medium and hotthe palak paneer (spinach cooked with homemade cheese) is earthy spicy and buttery  this is really really good  the only thing about the dish is that the ginger pieces were a little overwhelmingdessertgulab jamun (its like a deep fried dounut hole soaked in sugar syrup) has been my favorite indian dessert since childhood  not a lot of places know how to make this dessert right  it has to be lite and airy not dense and hard  maharani makes it just right and hot off of the stove!  its delicious! lunch buffet on a weekday  handful of people  i think im missing something considering all the great reviews  the selection is impressive  but its all very mediocre stuff  i just dont get it i really just dont  the chili chicken was like general tsos chicken (with indian flavor)  the chicken tikka wasnt even fried and the sauce was bland  the samosas were oily and bland  the garlic naan was dry  the chutneys were also just blah (mint and coconut)  same for the fish - bland boring no fish taste whatsoever  really just like a chinese buffet only indian-flavored  massive amounts of mediocre food  (and dont give me the price  ive had dirt cheap indian/pakistani stuff thats delicious)  besides 10 bucks for lunch is not cheap while im not an expert on indian cuisine i eat indian fairly regularly all over the us i like to compare my favorite dishes at different places and no place cooks every dish perfect therefore my review is based on the dishes i ate i ate here on a saturday night and it was not crowded no wait the decor and ambiance is like most indian restaurants not exactly pleasing mostly slightly worn out and not too tidy the staff was not exactly brimming with enthusiasm but were ok the food was good i had mulligatawny soup chicken tikka masala and plain naan and everything tasted very good over all a pleasant experience  i will definitely come back when im in madison ive only ever had takeout from this restaurant but so far ive been seriously impressed with the quality of the product weve ordered the lamb vindaloo and the chicken tikka masala on both occasions and i have been blown away by the flavor consistency of the sauces and high quality rice i am anxious to go back to visit in the restaurant to see if the service in-house matches up to the takeaway experience it is evidently a family run business and you can taste the difference in the recipes i keep realizing that its really unfair for me to expect amazing ethnic food in madison--its especially unfair to compare it to what i can get in ny of course that wont stop me from doing it so here goesmaharani is solid their lunch buffet is solid the food is good but certainly nothing specialand at $12 for the lunch buffet its also overpriced whenever yo make food en masse for a lunch buffet stuff is bound to get dry--thats how i felt with some of the food they had out on the plus side: good rice pudding (apparently im the only one who eats it) good goat curry nice (but basic) chicken tikka good baji and decent paneer minus side: fish was dry we werent given enough naan (i attribute this to the service) and the lamb they had was way way overcookedso would i go back? probably especially since its a group favorite of ours--we only go for lunch though and every few months at that three stars seems appropriate--it wasnt anything out of the ordinary and its certainly incomparable to what i can get on curry row (6th street) or curry (murray) hill the lunch buffet is awesome! you can get mild american-friendly dishes like chicken tikka masala and more authentic fares such as goat meat the buffet alofws you to try tastes of everything and go back and get more of what you love the naan is delicious and the tikka masala is the perfect thing for a cold day i know its not something that is typically done but one of my favorite things to eat at maharani is a few of the gulab jamun with some mango ice cream in the same dish lovely combination of textures and hot and cold so tasty and the perfect way to end a meal!i would probably visit just for the smells!service is good water glasses are constantly filled and plates are cleared quickly,3.6666666666666665,6
Chutney's Indian Cuisine,good food but the service was a let down!good:ambiencefooddecornot-so-good:servicei was really disappointed with the service the staff was unresponsive and super slow our table wasnt clean and we wanted to move to a booth but they didnt let us we had to wait endlessly to place our order for the food to arrive and for the staff to get our check  and yes the curries are served with a side of rice they forgot the rice part too i would be okay with all this if the place was overcrowded and there were too many orders but in our case the place was almost empty there were 3 to 4 other groups but they were done eating and ready to leave the food was good i specially liked the chicken tikka masala  malai kofta was good too their spice levels are from 1 - 10 anything beyond 5 would be really spicy ( i can handle medium to spicy food but not super spicy) went for dinner on a fri night  service was lacking and so was the foodour waiter - nice kid but didnt know the first thing about the food  we were actually amazed that the owner wouldnt take more care in teaching the staff  the manager was there nonchalantly walking around but never offered any help or even stop by to see how things werewe ordered palak paneer lamb keema chicken tikka masala and egg curry  the palak paneer was probably the best dish  the keemas spices were overpowering and was hard to eat  the tikka masala was ok but seemed to be missing something  overall the food was just ok and wont warrant a return trip i love it! as authentic indian food as it is finding this restaurant was like finding a gem! the chicken tikka massala and lamb curry were sooooo delicate and delicious it made me drool just to type this i will definitely be back for more! you walk in and it looks really clean decent  and somewhat upscale its like an mildy upscale indian cuisine restaurant  pretty legit  the food here is really good  i like it a lot - the lamb curry chicken tikka massala and other foods you would expect to be there are outstanding! howeverit just took extremely long for the food to come out and there was some type of miscommunication between the server and the kitchen because 3 out of the 5 orders at our table were wrong and its been around 45 min to an hour wait time since we were hungry we took the food anyway - but it was good!  so all in all - not bad food wise  for some reason or another - the service we got that day was extremely slow and flustered (which may come off as a first world problem) despite that i would still give this place another try because i truly enjoyed the food when we finally got it   with an attitude of gratitude i see the bright side that i actually got to eat that day as opposed to many that are struggling in the world - i cant bad mouth the place  i was fed i had the creepiest dining experience i have had in a long time here the other night i had been once before (i cant believe i didnt review) for the lunch buffet about a year or two ago and it was really good there was a wide variety of food and all was tastyanyway flash forward to last week i went for dinner with a friend we were one of two parties there and it was eerily quiet our waitress was a bit odd but nice enough the food was expensive and they were trying to push drinks and appetizers and whatnoti felt like they were a bit disappointed when we just shared one entree and some naan we got the chicken tikka masala and it was good but not as good as i had remembered it from the buffet about half way through the meal we were the only people in the restaurant (at like 6:45) and it felt like the employees were all staring at usthey had nothing else to do it was just an odd feeling i would consider going back for the lunch buffet but dont think i would eat there for dinner again,3.0,5
Masala Bay Fine Indian Dining,decent indian food in the area parking can be a bit tricky and when its raining you may have some trouble walking in the entryway that said we thoroughly enjoyed our meal here chicken tikka masala butter chicken naan and rice filled us up just enough the prices seemed a little high for what we got other than that id probably stop in here again if i were in the area and craving indian food,3.0,1
Guru Palace,ive been scouring the valley for a good indian food place and was hoping that guru palace would/could be iti was mistaken its not bad its not good its just kind of  there ill eat there again if someone suggests it but i wont go out of my way to offer it as a place for my friends and i to gatheri was there for the lunch time buffet that was priced at $899  not bad my friend and i were offered naan and i was about to say yes when my friend asked if we would be charged extra for it - we werentthey had chicken tikka masala and chicken korma out the chicken tikka masala was ok but nothing to write home about as was the chicken korma i decided to sample their palak paneer and found it was the best thing they had i also tried their curried pakorabig mistake i like pakora but to combine it in a generic yellow curry sauce was a mistake it just wasnt right it didnt taste right either - neither to myself or my friendas i said the food was ok i was impressed with the decor and the overall cleanliness of the restaurantthe servers were attentive and friendly i swear for every sip of water i took someone was there topping off my glass i like thatill give it a go again and see if they can change my ratingbut ill wait till a friend suggests we go guru palace has quickly become the favorite lunch spot of mine and another coworkerwhile i wouldnt typically recommend an indian lunch buffet - this place has a great one its like $8 and the selection is much wider than what is typically served at other buffets -- and the dishes changes from day-to-day so thats nice too along with the ever-present chana masala and chicken tikka masala theres usually several other veggie dishes like pureed eggplant or eggplant and potato its all quite good there are always three desserts too and the chai is deliciousthe highpoints however are the fresh garlic naan they bring (best in the valley imo) and the very friendly waitstaff who i think are the owners too this little strip mall indian restaurant gets a bonus point for being so beautiful inside  very contemporary with traditional flair  it gets minus one point beacuse it was hot  was tha/c broken or was the foods spicey nature taking advantage of me?  it was slightly unpleasant but i will get over it  the guru palace gets 3 solid stars on its very friendly helpful service and its wonderful food  i have only dined here twice and it was consitantly goodthis time from the $899 buffett i tried the palaak paneer which is excellent i of course had a piece of the tandoori chicken (thigh piece i think  i have a thing for meat on the bone-dont care for it  thats  why i prefer chicken tikka)  it was good but not as good as the chicken marsala  pungent and very flavorful the rice was a differnt form today-not basmati which i prefer  there was a new dish i did not recognize called mushroom matar (?)  it was delicious with bits of onion and peas in a tangy light gravy of sort  i also enjoy the garlic naan  no papdum was offerred this time  i did enjoy a split of champagne which compliments the delightful spicey flavors without filling you upi was so warm from the lack of a/c and hot spicy achaar chutney (my favorite) that i was melting like the wicked witch at my table the service was very friendly and i dont know how anyone could call this expensive  i thought it was downright cheap!  $399 for champagne plus two full plates of great food  it is a great place to stop in for reliable food kind staff and beutiful dining room let me preface this by saying im indian and regularly dine at indian restaurants in the valley so if you are someone like me who is interested in reading something other than their buffet was a great deal   then read on  wait while im at it people please dont view indian restaurants like chinese buffets its not about how much you can pile on your plate in fact indian restaurants put out their worst food at buffets because they know the mainstream only care about piling on bad food as long as its cheap for the rest of us who care about quality this review is for you i think you will be impressed with this restaurant if you are indian and you have lived in phoenix you know the phoenix metro lacks quality indian restaurants and you settle on the ones they have that being said this is truly a normal indian restaurant that you are used to from back home (ny chicago la sf boston dallas houston etc)  first the restaurant was clean and open it had vaulted ceilings and plenty of space so it wasnt claustrophobic inside  the ambience was nice yet not stuffy  it was trendy enough but not overly cliche with cheesy gold and brass everywhere  the service was great and timely  the waiters were indians who were american raised so they could speak english most of the indian restaurants in the valley hire hispanics or indians who dont speak english well so that was a plus its location is a plus although technically the restaurant is in mesa think gilbert because the restaurant is basically at the intersection at gilbert and baseline right at the border of gilbert and mesa so its in a nice area that is safe the food: this is a true punjabi owned and operated restaurant so their north indian dishes are the real thing their chicken tikka masala had a nice smooth and consistent texture that was not grainy or overly creamy the meat was succulent and not overcooked  the naan was great and its hard to criticize it but honestly ive had better naan at other restaurants their naan was a little doughy but at least it was large and not some cheap small portion (india palace)  the palak paneer is honestly the best in the city  it wasnt soupy/liquidy in consistency like most of the restaurants  it had flavor and was cooked perfectly  palak paneer is a tough dish to make and most of the phoenix restaurants mess it up by making this cream of spinach soup rather than a proper sabji  their malai kofta was their only real flaw of the evening as the kofta balls were not properly fried nor did they maintain their shape  it was more or less just a curry it was improperly cooked this is the best indian restaurant in the valley  royal taj in tempe is a close second but this is the best the entire time i was here i kept thinking back to the scene in the namesake where the family is eating together during the fathers funeral  morbid i know but when i watched the film all i wanted was some good indian food and living in chandler these days i knew that was going to be difficult to come by  at least until i found guru palace that isthe bhindi (okra) was perfect  crispy not soggy  all of the sauces were of the non-oily indian variety (a serious plus) and my wife moaned a few times while swirling her garlic nan/chicken tikka masala burrito (her invention) around in her mouth  damn chicken tikka masala and its power over the one woman in my life!the only sad part of the experience was not seeing gajar halva (carrot pudding) on the menu  gp starts making that and its deliciousness matches the rest of the food and five stars will be imminent its slipped a notch! a little disappointed this time the tandoori chicken was disappointing but better than most places in phoenix they served it sizzling but there were only 4 pieces of chicken which is small most tandoori chicken serves 6-8 pieces and the pieces are generally bigger; ive eaten at many indian restaurants all over the country and that is fairly standard for a good indian restaurant but for whatever reason none of the indian restaurants in phoenix can manage to produce the type of quality tandoori chicken that you get in ny boston dallas houston etc the chicken wasnt marinated either so the meat wasnt as flavorful the tandoori chicken at taj mahal is better and more flavorful the service was also a little lackluster it depends on who you get as your server the female servers are really nice but one of the gentleman who waits tables is not that friendly and he essentially forgot about usfurthermore the chicken vindaloo claims it has pieces of white mean on the menu but it was all dark meat chicken which is a little careless and cheap on behalf the restaurant ive also been served the wrong curry in the past and had to argue my case (it was obvious you cant mistake chicken tikka masala for another curry)at this point i would have to say taj mahal is the best indian restaurant in the city their service is better and the so is their food but guru palace is still excellent and the second or third best restaurant but was disappointed having frequented the owners (or owners family) other establishment (indian delhi palace) i was super excited when this placed opened (a while back but just getting around to a review) as its a mile from my housein my opinion nothing is better hangover/post drinking food than an indian buffet  the heavy food sops up all the previous nights sins and leaves you satisfactorily sleepy and ready for a nap to get you ready for that nights activitiesbeing indian the quality of food really does matter to menot just the hangover cure aspects of it  this place is solid  i consider the indian dehli palace the best in the valley and this place comes in a close second  chicken tikka masala and the chana masala (my two faves) are perfect  i do prefer my food to be a little more spicy but i understand theyre trying to cater to all palates so adding some of the spicy chutneys they offer does the trick just fine  speaking of the chutney they offer a nice assortment of accoutrements with the buffet  we have been here a couple of times for dinner and have enjoyed pretty much everything we ordered off the menumy parents are vegetarian and all the veggie dishes are awesome  the only thing i think could be a little better is the naan  its good but indian dehli palace has it beat in that respect  everything else is similar in flavorthe atmosphere is the best ive witnessed in an az indian restaurant  nicely decorated and they even have special tables where you can sit on the floor indian style  pretty fun for a datethe service can be a little slow when they are moderately full but thats only an issue when youre there for dinner  doesnt really matter for the buffetall in all always a great experience here ive only been for the lunchtime buffet but i really enjoy it they dont have a huge number of dishes but the ones they do have are very good the chicken tikka masala is the best ive had anywhere hands down i could drink the sauce in a cup i tell youthe other dishes are fairly basic but well prepared it bothers me a little bit that they ask you if you want plain or garlic bread instead of naan the all-you-can-drink chai tea is a nice plus great indian food! i always get hot fresh food that hits the spot every time love this place go & try the chicken tikka not tikka masala just the tikka with rice & garlic naan - i promise youll go back again and again and again i would have given 4 stars except for one thingpoor service  the food here is excellent full of flavor that pops and stimulates your senses however they need improve the quality of service  the waitresses are consistently busy but pay more attention to everything other than the customer  we sat and watched 3 ladies walking around cleaning tables folding napkins preparing appetizers etcetc for 20 min before they asked if we needed anything else  the only reason is because my wife had to flag them down waving her hands just to get more water  there were no lines of people waiting so why the urgency to clean and do prep work instead of taking care of the current customers there?  to make is worse an indian couple and their son came in  (sat next to us) and got an order of naan drinks and special requested sauce immediately  definitely felt discriminated  the guy even turned around to me with a cocky smirk on his face as to sayi deserve better service than you because im indianhah!!!  another thing to add i ordered the chicken tikka masala with 5 star heat  when it finally came it was zero heat  i had it sent back and it was about 2 star heat  it is such a shame because i really really want to go back but i think its time to try someplace else i bought a groupon for guru palace a few weeks ago and just used it this evening boy am i glad that i did!  the food was delicious the service was quick and efficient and really friendly and did i mention that the food was delicious?first thing is first the food was incredible  my companion and i ordered the samosa appetizer garlic naan lamb korma and chicken tikka masala  i also had an indian tea (chai) which was perfectly spiced  the samosa was amazing the filling was moist and flavorful and the crust was delicate and flaky  there was just the slightest hint of sweetness to the filling that really perfected the dish  the garlic naan is the best that ive ever had!  i think i could happily make a meal of just the garlic naan and not regret it the lamb korma was also amazing the lamb was tender and flavorful and the sauce was rich and thick  the chicken tikka masala (a staple in my life) was to die for!  the chicken was super tender and swimming in amazing thick rich sauce  the spice level was perfect in all the dishes- the server asked us on a scale of 1-10 how spicy we wanted our dishes and we ordered a 7  i can honestly find no fault with any of the dishes i sampled!the service is really great as well  i was meeting my companion at the restaurant and i was the first to arrive; the staff greeted me promptly and made sure that i was comfortable while i waited  as soon as my dinner companion arrived we were seated and served water and complimentary papadum with a delicious chutney  i really liked our server (and all the other staff members that spoke to us) he was efficient and friendly and happily recommended his favorite samosa variety when we expressed interest  during our meal three different people (one being the owner i believe) stopped by to make sure that everything was good and that we were pleased with our meal and service  i appreciated the attention which felt genuine and was not at all bothersome the atmosphere in the restaurant was also wonderful  it is not a large place but the tables are all well spaced and the entire place is impeccably decorated  there is a lot of art on the walls ambient lighting soft music and well dressed staff  though it is still a casual restaurant its also nice enough to feel really good about taking a date there i really enjoyed my meal and service at guru palace and i will definitely be returning soon! after another indian place in the area closed down several months ago this has become our go-to place for dates  weve not tested the menu extensively but the chicken dishes weve tried (tikka masala chicken tikka and tandoori chicken) have all been delicious though the serving size on the tikka masala always seems a bit on the small side given the price and how much chicken is included with other dishes  weve always found the service to be decent though not stellar and the staff friendly and helpful  the ambiance is also just average but the food keeps us going back  it is not a 5-star place but i have no problems giving it 4 stars and recommending it others in just one visit we were able to sample a wide variety of great indian cuisine the chicken tikka masala is incredibly smooth the chicken biryani is great for anyone who is not fond of spicier dishes the lamb vindaloo is fantastic and the perfect amount of spice for the dish for dessert we sampled the gulab jamun which is absolutely delightful the service was excellent with plenty of beverage refill offers and check ins from the staff so i wondered into this place today for lunch the venue was nice and the service was mediocre the place was very dim which may hide the full effect of either a clean or dirty venue they did boast an a rating on their most recent health inspection so that is good to know the buffet was adequate and stock with traditional indian dishes chicken tikka pakoras lentils chickpeas rice curry of sorts  etc i ate rice the red chicken some ckickpeas some eggplant zucchini pakoras naan the rice was basmati and a little dry the red chicken was good chickpeas a little sandy the eggplant/lentils was goodthe chicken tikka was a little dry even in all that sauce the naan was garlic and good i ate all my food and although being in good old gilbert/mesa az felt as though this was authentic and close to what i consider northern indian maybe even punjab style i would recommend this to a friend with slight reservation  ill eventually return but going out of my way to do so we love this place and go often for a wide variety of indian foods offered on their buffet generally i avoid buffets like the plague but this is an exception from the chicken tikka masala to the saag paneer  tandoori chicken curried mutton  and creative vegetarian optionsit is love at first bite the naan is fresh and delicious i like the sauces they have available and the lassi always tastes just right- not too sweet i am dinging a star because it is very very dark in there during the day this concerns me what is being hidden?  it doesnt create much of an ambiance it is literally difficult to see your food secondly i think the service is subpar people pile their used plates up and they dont seem to get bussed away a water refill would be nice without having to ask as the food is spicy for a place where most diners have the buffet during the day it doenst seem there is that much that the servers need to do let a little light in the restaurant  and add a bus person and the fifth star is yours! best indian food ever great service great food  their chicken tikka masala is so yummy  if you are looking for good quality food  this is it highly recommended weve been eating indian food elsewhere for the past year and now i could kick myself! hubs and i had an exceedingly rare date night with no picky eaters (read: 9 year old food snob and friends) we considered going to our regular place but i was just not willing to dine in there  during our east valley feed me yelp search i remembered that i park in front of this place when i go to michaels/starbucks and dared my man to try a new place i argued that i always see folks walking out of this place looking happy (during lunchtime) when they leave (usually a good sign right?)  so off we went into the wild blue oh wait no we just traveled down baseline rd for a short jaunt and reached our destination we arrived at what i would call dinner time but there was only 1 large group and 1 small table finishing up  were in gilbert folks when its dinner time people swarm to restaurants and pack em solid for unholy hours on end  many a time we have left an establishment only to go to plan b restaurant or even plan c  ill admit it i was cautiously cautious  as we ordered i noticed others starting to move in before long there were at least 5 or 6 other tables gaily orderingbefore long seriously sam our waiter was totally on top of it sam arrives and since we are first-timers we asked him to guide us through the menu what a great tour it was!  we thought wed just go with the regular go-to menu items but sam wasnt having any of that nooooooo he wanted us to try what the regular clientele swore to be the best food on the menu obviously these customers are not wrong! we devoured the suggested vegetable pakoras $499 (im not a sauce freak but i recommend the sauce that comes with it!  then sam told us to try the mixed grill sizzler plate (under tandoor specials) just yes!  he had the chef spice it at a level 4-5 to be safe and it was perfect sure we couldve gone warmer but nah!  ohhhh naan how about some garlic naan $25 uhm yummy! it wasnt so heavy garlicky that vamps would cringe but it was enough to be flavorful the garlic naan paired perfectly with what we know to be called butter chicken (or chicken tikka masala) but this time with a twist it was dark meat instead of chicken breast  we casually mentioned that cannot tolerate chicken breast so sam ordered this other version (ask what its called because i cant remember) sam earned a place in my heart forever!  this waiter sam did something unheard of in todays culture he listened and adjusted the order accordingly whoajust after our tikka arrived and i was able to scoop the yum yum worthy rice on my plate the aforementioned 9 year old calls our mobile in a panic  where are you?? were here no one is home!  well crud dinner date over with a quickness the staff got us packed up as fast as lightening got our check but not before i said i want another order to go! did that slow down this restaurant heck no! i was packed up with a second order an adjusted bill and off we went i promise you sam (and all you other amazing wait staff) i will be back oh yes i will and next time im bringing my posse but please dont tell anyone in gilbert about this place i still want a table at dinner time ok?!,4.176470588235294,17
Khyber Halal,we went for dinner on sunday and the restaurant was closed not the ones to lose hope we drove 35 miles again for dinner today we were the only two at 6 for dinner they are closed on sundays though the website seems to show openmy husband ordered chicken malai boti and chicken tikka masala with naan he really enjoyed his dishes i ordered kabuli pulav and vegetable kabab the rice was flavorful and the kabab well grilled the food is freshly made so it took them around 20 min to serve our dinnerwe plan to go back again and try some curriesone negative thing is the location the restaurant surroundings seemed to be shady this place has some seriously delicious food but the service isnt going to wow you (i suggest take-out if youre wary) and now that youve been warned on to the deliciousness!i shared veggie kabob and rice beef egg rolls and chicken tikka masala im happy to say that you get a ton of food with your order! the veggie kabobs were served on a huge bed of rice and they were super fresh and flavorful theyre simple but great! the egg rolls which are only $099 a pop were also very tasty albeit a little greasy (theyre deep-fried egg rolls though) i also cant forget to mention that the egg rolls come with a great spicy sauce! and then there was chicken tikka masala at $1099 its not the cheapest thing on the menu but damn! it was sincerely some of the best chicken tikka masala that ive had in the valley (almost inching out one of my favorites at z-grill) they served it with an enormous piece of house-made naan the masala was perfectly balanced in spiciness and thickness and the chicken was cooked just right! masala lovers from all over should try it!i welcome khyber halal with open arms into the neighborhood! im always a fan of a new flavor in the area and i cant wait to go again! we went out last night to the movies and with an hour and a half to spare we thought we had time to stop at this newish restaurant on the corner of indian school and 24th st it was a family owned place baby in bassinet by the cashier and absolutely no explanations of what the food is just strange names we ordered and sat down 35-40 minutes later we realized the food still hadnt come and wed never make it out to scottsdale for our movie so disappointed we took the food when it finally came and brought it home and ordered something up on amazon when i dove into the to go boxes i stopped complaining man that food was delicious i ordered the chicken tikka only because i pretty much knew what it would be and it far beat my expectations our chicken kabab (ordered again because we knew what it would be) was delicious as well to the owners thank you for being here well be back please develop something that describes the food and make a non-egg version of the naan bread please! lots of vegans and allergies out there who dont expect food from  your region to have heavy eggs included readers as long as you set your expectations correctly about time for food preparation youll be very happy with khyber halal get in there and support this neighborhood gem! here it ismy 100th reviewand i dont have a speech preparedoh well here goes!go here (http://khyberhalalblogspotcom/) to see pictures and descriptions of the food on their menu it is very accurate although the mantoo picture doesnt really emphasize that it is 12 pieces of deliciousnessthis place is fricking amazing the service was excellent as well as friendly and it smells simply divineafter several months of saying we need to stop at this place one day we finally made it there last night for take-out we ordered the following:1) chicken karahimmmmmm mmmmmmm! we got an order of basmati rice and the flavors of this bone-in (but cut into manageable pieces) was fantastic never had anything like it but it was awesome i woke up this morning wanting morebut there was none2) mantoothis was possibly the star of an all-star show we decided that they reminded us of dumplings or of non-fried crab rangoon only filled with ground beef seasonings and topped with one (technically two?) of the most delightful sauces ever 3) chicken tikka masala - i chose medium spicy this timeyou know i had to have it and it was delicious (we also had the basmati rice with this one because its a saucy dish and thats how i like itif you ask nicely they may let you substitute the naan that it comes with for rice instead)4) beef samosas and chicken samosasboth were fantastic but i think i loved the beef one just a *little* bit more the seasoning was superb we also dipped it into the sauce that came with the mantooomfgwow 5) garlic naanive never met a garlic naan that i didnt like6) baklawa (aka baklava)one of the best ive ever had nutty and honey-eymmmmwere actually planning on going back again tomorrow night so i can try the okra bamya and the eggplant banjan and see what that bolanee/aloo paratha is all about undiscovered gem! this place is fantastic the restaurant sits in a nondescript strip center on southwest corner of indian school & 24th st since it was the first time we had been there i decided to try a bunch of different items and see what we liked chicken tikka masala was rich and spicy very good chicken malai boti was green (yea green) grilled and really flavorfulvegetable briyani was standard rice with veggies still goodmantoo was the highlight! little dumplings stuffed with meat they are topped with a combination of curry and yogurt so so goodyou should definitely check this place out the ambiance will not overwhelm you but the food certainly will this review is long overdue partially because i keep telling myself that im going to write a review after the next time i go to khyber halal so after our 4th dining experience there here i go!the first time we tried to go to khyber halal we were able to go inside the restaurant but they told us they werent doing dinner service because they were catering a banquet dinner off site no problem we made arrangements to go back a few weeks later our next visit was during ramadan we didnt know that until we arrived to see a big sign on the door saying that they were observing the month long holiday not to be deterred we came back a few weeks later and were seated by a friendly young man (presumably the owners son?) and we waited and waited finally about 10 minutes later i was able to call someone over to take our order and get waters for the table we ordered the chicken tikka masala saag paneer mantoo samosas and brown rice the samosas were a bit dry and the chutney that was served with them was nice but in styrofoam containers i have absolutely nothing but positive things to say about the rest of the meal fantastic flavorful and probably impossible to beat for the prices at this restaurant our waters werent refilled throughout our meal but we almost didnt notice because the food was so good we didnt need to order extra naan as they make sure you get enough bread to feed an army with an appetizer a few sides and three entrees our meal was less than $40 our next 3 visits were a bit more of the same lackluster service outstanding food its why we keep going back i keep saying i wish someone would nominate khyber halal for a restaurant impossible or kitchen nightmares type show they need a visual makeover and the sons could take a lesson in service again they are super friendly but have probably never worked in a restaurant before this place would be a 5 if they could get their skills up to par a bit dont let the service keep you away if this place was around the corner from me id be here a few times a week for lunch see you soon khyber! mutton karahi or goat curry was awesome and different not sure what it was exactly calledtheir kebabs and tikkas were deliciousnihari was good toochicken tikka masala was a little too saltya great joint offering a variety of food clean and family friendly a must eat halal option in phoenix az amazing pakistai/afghan food best ive had in the valley family run with very nice owners chicken tikka masala goat karahi and beef bihari are my favs after being stuck in the rural midwest for two years where food options were extremely limited this place was a nice find for lunch  glad to have my pakistani/indian yelpie friend present to order as i had no idea what to do  we got chicken karahi goat biryani chicken tikka masala and chickpeas with some naan to share  food came out looking looking very homey and overall tasted very good the karahi was by far the best - very tender and moist chicken that i mopped up with naan  tikka masala was also tasty and had a nice kick (you can adjust spice levels)  the rice:goat ratio on the biryani was high and while i usually like goat this was a bit gamey and dry service was slow given there werent many other diners at the restaurant  however portions were huge and very reasonably priced  total bill was $44 for 4  and we left stuffed with 4 full boxes of leftovers i would come back for more karahi and to try some other dishes probably for dinner though as the food is pretty heavy for lunch very good! reminds me of my moms cookingthe chicken karahi is light but very flavorful the portion is also really large the chicken tikka masala was very good i was a little disappointed by the goat biryani - the portion size was good but the rice was dry i also thought the raita (accompanying yogurt) was a little bland the chick pea masala was pretty good but a little simple for my taste still it was nice that it wasnt drowned in overpowering spicesthe service is slow but i think the prices are reasonable i could definitely see this place becoming my go to indian/pakistani restaurant in phoenix after reading other reviews i tried the chicken tikka masala i got it spicy but not over the top spicy it was very good the chicken was cooked perfect the staff was very friendly lots of dishes to choose from i ordered the chicken kabob and chicken tikka masala spicy caution do not order spicy unless you can handle some serious heat decent price and good portions i will visit again the food was deliciousnext time im going to try the afghani specialty menu came in today with my daughter we both enjoyed our experience chicken tikka masala and chicken handi was delicious nice and spicy hummus was perfect coming back soon great family run place two brothers work up front and are good kids! ive eaten khyber halal twice now both times for take out everything ive had there is pretty delicious definitely good indian/pakistani/afghan food for the valley the chicken tikka masala was classically delish i feel like its hard to go wrong with heavily spiced and sauced chicken the naan was fabulous and if i werent so full from the other things on my plate i would have eaten much more of it definitely worth eating with sauce alone lamb kabobs are also a solid choice again another classic dish that its hard to go wrong with what really stood out for me though was the mantoo! i ordered the mantoo on a lonely night at home by the recommendation of the guy behind the counter it was so garlic-y but soo meaty creamy and delicious my roommates were flabbergasted by the smell of the house when they got home and i definitely couldnt finish a full order of the garlicy goodness on my own ill definitely go back and try more options but im excited to get more mantoo in my belly (hopefully chased with some naan next time to dull the spices) plan accordingly folks leave room for the sweets! you may over order with your eyes temptation may give in as you eagerly dig into your meals pace yourself or youll be stuffed as your fork hits the bottom of that plate trust me in your lifetime everyone should try a gulab jamun in laymens terms that would be a little ball of dough two of these ping pong sized balls come in a container you wont want to share i mean the civil thing would be to share but really once your spoon touches the sweet cardamom syrup thats involved mmmi dont think so a moment on the lips a memory forevermoving on just remember to leave room for dessert there are other sweets available up front to choose from ill report back next time (gosh darn it theyve got me)zipping into the nondescript shopping center we studied the menu upfront we seated ourselves in the dining area which is a no-frills kind of place (theres a tv if anyone really really needs that) our server was quick to take our order and our food was out lickity splitspicy means hot! (if you opt for spicy be prepared) the chicken tikka masala was divine with copious amounts of chicken served with four large artistically cut pieces of naan leftovers abound  the kabli pulao really does come with a foot long serving of a beef shish kabob  (the beef has been shredded and molded into this arc of a shape) the rice was airy and well balanced with raisins and shredded carrotsthe accompanying chatni sauce was a delightful surprise on top of all the goodness involved note that there is no beer or alcohol on the menujust remember pace yourselves! im trying to remember how we heard about this cool afghan restaurant do remember seeing good friend and party queen irene v in the reviews and had to check them outinside is very clean and the decor is casual and fun this is a nice family owned restaurant and you can feel that vibe right away the kids work the front part of the restaurant and mom does her magic in the kitchenstarted off with some chicken and beef samosas and went with the famous chicken tikka masala extra spicy it was delicious and had plenty of tasty flavors bursting in my mouth the heat level was very high and perfect for my taste buds nice!came back again and ordered the kabli pulao (kofta) plate again the portion size and the flavors were exceptional and even had some left to bring home really love the way she makes the rice with the raisins and carrots in the dish going to have to try and reproduce this bad boy at homethey have a rather large menu that can accommodate almost any diet or request appetizers snacks kababs currys wraps burgers and vegetarian choices if you are in the mood for a meat free meal they also have a good variety of sweet desserts to cap off your visitservice is friendly and the food is delicious cant wait to bring the family back and maybe get me some goat on my next visit im getting hungry just thinking about it oh yeah!5 stars,4.25,16
Namaste Indian Cuisine,judging from the range of scores from other reviewers i think your liking of namaste might be based on a particular preference toward indian food done a specific wayi couldnt quite put my finger on what it was but i just didnt enjoy my meal here very muchthe chicken tikka masala was filled with huge chunks of dark meat chicken im not usually a fan of dark meat but indian cuisine usually gets it to really blend with the sauces and spices this wasnt the case here - it was like tasteless brown meat dipped on saucemeat and veg dishes on the lunch buffet were ok but a little odd - paneer mixed in with a dry sort of veg offering was a little unusual and out of placeoverall ok but not in my first few choices for vegas indian my fav indian food restaurant for dinner~ we had the tasting set dinner for two people and everything was soooo flavorful  the chicken tikka masala tasted great i suppose they make it with really flavorful tandoori chicken and the sauce has a great depth in taste  the spinach paneer and lamb was also savory and you can really have a good taste of the spices from their dishes went there last week for the buffet everything was good but not a lot of variety  dinner was better indian lunch buffets were on my mind especially have hearing misti y praise their deliciousnesswe pull into commercial center at 1:45 pm on a sunday  as we park the car we notice there arent too many other cars parked out front  hmmmas we open the door what a shock to see!  the place was packed full of indians!  this was a great sign! i wasnt sure if there was a wait with all the people standing around of if there was a private party  with no one to greet us at the front the husband goes in search of an empty table  he finds one last table at the far back and after checking with a waiter i get the affirmative wave  i tell him to start first on the buffet line  meanwhile i ask a waiter for some utensilswhen the waiter brings over our water he apologizes as a tour group had just arrived which explains all the craziness  nonetheless an indian tour group stops at namaste in commercial center of all places for their lunch en route is still a good sign!my turn at the buffet line!  now im no expert on indian buffets as ive been to only a couple  but i think the spread was pretty good for $899!my favorite was the vegetable korma vegetable cooked in creamy cashew nut gravy finished with almond and garnished with coriander and cream  this was good on rice or the hot naan unleavened white bread they provided  i also liked the sauce from the chicken tikka masala tender pieces of chicken breast roasted in homemade creamy tomato however we both found the chicken pieces itself to be dry  i also liked the allo jerra which were ultimately potatoesthe husband was loving the saag paneer spinach cooked with homemade cheese and the goat curry  other items on the buffet line were pakara a fried veggie cholle masala a dish with chickpeas; and a cabbage masala  something that was both new to us was the uttapam a thick pancake with a sour-like taste that was topped with a bit of tomato and onion  traditionally its made from rice that has been fermented which explains its tangy tastefinishing off the meal was the kheer traditional indian rice pudding with nuts flavored with cardamon and roseat one point i helped myself to the water pitcher  (i wasnt sure if this was self serve since there were about four water pitchers right next to where we were sitting and the place was so crowded  they did end up refilling my glass the next 4-5 times though)  the waiters were pretty friendly to us once the crowd got settled in more and started clearing out  they were quick to clear out our dirty dishes and refill the water glassesnamaste also has a simple but pleasant decor with its mango painted walls which im sure makes one crave a mango lassioverall definitely not a bad choice for an indian buffet  i was so stuffed from that meal that i didnt eat again until 10 pm that night! i dont know if its always this busy on sundays though so keep that in mind! sweet and simplethis place is fantasticmy boyfriend told me about this place so we decided to goi hadnt eaten india food in a while so i was up for something different anything you try you will likethey also ask you how spicy you would like your food and it came out perfect i had the chicken tikka masalaamazingit was lil spicy and full of flavor my boyfriend had the lamb in a cashew gravy with the garlic naanit was so goodwe finished everything and didnt feel full i would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for something different besides bar food5 stars in my bookoh and the staff was greatvery nice and fast servicewe will be back very soon ive been here once before and thought it was fantastic this time we walked in and they pretty much told us we had to get the buffet which i didnt even know was an option for dinner we told her we had a groupon and she said theyd still take it i think we appeared disappointed so she encouraged us to check out the buffet and gave us time to decide the buffet had limited items but we were probably going to get chicken tikka masala or curry anyway and both were on the buffet our groupon was set to expire in a week so we figured we better just use it i think the owner sensed our hesitation and finally offered us the whole menu but she said itd be a long wait for food nice they were getting busy only the booths were occupied so it didnt seem busy but we decided to stick with the buffet option we were pretty hungry she also moved us to a different booth both of which seemed dirty very confusingwe were given a fresh basket of naan and our drinks and on to the buffet i think the chicken curry was the best thing on the buffet but was pretty picked through and there wasnt much left tikka masala was kind of bland i make better at home the tandoori chicken was good but we kept getting little broken bits of bone in the meat around the whole bone i didnt really like their dal eitherthe entire time we were there workers kept walking back and forth with big sheets to set tables arent they closed after lunch to do this? we got there about 6 so there couldnt have been that many people in and out that quickly the waitress/owner was very nice and apologetic throughout but the entire experience was strange with all the good indian options in town i doubt ill go back,3.4,5
Taza Indian Kitchen,take out only review*i am so very happy there is now an indian restaurant in our neighborhood  i was near ecstatic when i learned of their upcoming opening  ive been peeking in windows and organizing a weekly drive-by to check on their progress  well after all of my patient waiting they finally opened yesterdayas i am recovering from the nasty cold that has taken over much of the henderson/lv population my husband and i decided to get some food to go  it took forever  i mean when the women at the counter said 25 minutes she meant 35+  (opening day i cant take much issue with this  however i do feel as if no place should open until they are ready) i think she may be one of the owners  nice lady but you could see she was exhausted from the initial opening of the establishment  in any case we ordered the samosas which they were out of  instead we ordered the onion bhajis  what we received were the vegetable pakoras  they were really good  crispy and light yet still dense and fulfilling  the cilantro sauce was awesome  spicy and just tart enough  for our entrees my husband ordered the chicken tikka masala ($15) as he always does  we think this was another mix up because quite frankly it wasnt very creamy and it had way too many peppers and onions in it which leads me to believe it was the chicken jalfrazi  that would explain the extra spiciness that one usually does not find in tikka masala  they have you order by #  which i think is going to be kind of challenging given the goofs we have experienced thus far  again first dayi ordered the lamb korma ($16)  oh my goodness it was wonderful  the lamb was tender and falling apart  the sauce was very flavorful and had just the right amount of heat so i could feel a bit of sweat building up on my chin  yummmy!  i loved mine a lotwe also had some saffron rice ($4)  it was tasty too  nothing special its rice after all  there prices are a bit more expensive than our usual india palace but the portions are substantially larger  allowing more than enough for leftovers  except for the rice if two want leftovers the next day order 2 sides of rice  final verdict i will definitely go back for some more and dine in this time as i need to make an update on the floor servicethe interior is lovely but the lighting was a bit too bright when we were there  also they should have had some fabric draped from the ceilings as it would have make a marked difference to the level of coziness and warmth  ps  daily lunch buffet if youre into that kind of thing ahhh sooo much opportunity the only indian food in henderson area!  they could make a killing!  weve waited so long!  so disappointed!i stopped by earlier in the day to review the menu since i was in the area and happily found they had pani poori and chaat and other non-standard fare - pretty much the only nice sit-down restaurant in all of las vegas that serves pani poori afaik but i digress  well i convinced my so to go down there and give them a shot  we get seated and order some chaat - which was ok but not as good as i remember it   fine  we tried to order the samosas too (like the first review) but they were still out after 3 days?  indian restaurant with no samosas?  its like peanut butter and no jelly!   turner and no hooch! ahh lets move on  we also ordered a full dish of tandoori chicken and chicken tikka masala curry   the food comes out relatively fast - but we had the same problem as the first reviewer - the curry had no curry!  normally the complaint is too much sauce no meat  this was all meat onions and peppers and a tiny bit of curry  that would have been ok but the meat was tough?  tough over cooked meat?  i cant even remember the last time i ever had overcooked chicken in a restaurant  maybe at some backyard bbq when they forgot to check on it after 30 minutes but not in a restaurant!  not for a $15 dish!!  dry tough chicken yuckthe full dish of tandoori chicken for $15 is big  so big it barely fits on the serving plate  thats cool and all but im making a mess just trying to get food off the plate  plus the tandoori is dry too!  wtf!!  its supposed to be succulent and appetizing and yummy  instead were both depressed and barely touch either dish  we get it to go for lunch tomorrow  i wake up the next day and what do i find my so doing?  cooking lunch  she wont even take this stuff to work  shed rather spend 2 hours cooking something than eat that meal  *sigh*  such high hopes!sorry taza  please learn how to cook the chicken?  is that too much to ask? i went here with a couple of friends on a monday night we were greeted by a gracious hostess and immediately seated in a large booth the atmosphere was great and the restaurant was quietthen we opened the menu everything seemed rather expensive but we still ordered chicken tikka masala chicken curry and lamb curry all with sides of saffron rice (not included in the price by the way) and naanthe portions were small especially for what we paid also we noticed that the chicken dishes were very salty the lamb was overcooked but it was probably microwaved since we got there towards the closingwe wont be going back here and continue our search for a decent indian place in las vegas,2.3333333333333335,3
Karaikudi Palace,went with spouse for buffet on a friday as a vegetarian i didnt eat the other non veg varieties but i can say this the food tastes really good three varieties of desserts and four options at least for veg and non veg curries they provide complimentary masala dosa and  nan so its your choice what to eat with most other indian restaurants its an either/ or the veggie bondas( dumplings) were amazing just the right amount of spice and the chutneys to accompany them were tasty too as for non veg curries they had south indian tamilian pepper fry versions of lamb and to cater to the nan chicken tikka masala their a la carte menu looks extensive will go back for dinner definitely hope they remain true to the tamilian tradition and offer more authentic dishes i am a blatantly honest critic and i am seriously unforgiving when it comes to restaurant owners trying to make a few bucks more saving on labor a restaurant of this size on a saturday nigh should have no more than 3-5 tables per station until close to closing time and maybe dropping a little these guys maybe had 2 for the whole restaurant and a busser come waitresshere is the plus:vegetarian dishesconsistently good indian food - their taste is always pretty good for all the dishes i experienced its all services issues that lost them all the stars all a result of simply not enough people servicing their gueststhe negative:1) warm tap water served (dude: ice is free!)2)  no water for the toddler more than 15 minutes after requesting3) food order taken 15 minutes after seating4) appetizer came during dinner after 45 minutes5) food came out at different times for a 2 1/2 topthe absolutely unforgivable:in a vegetarian restaurant serving chicken tikka masala when the guest specifically asked for paneer tikka masala my best advice: go with their buffet when they have it currently its lunch only if you are vegan double check your order when it comes as they made this critical mistake today simply due to carelessness if you go in the evenings than go with the expectation of poor service if you are coming in during peak times no large parties or you guys will get your food in about a 30 minute span of each other despite serving good quality food i cant allow lazy owners to get a good review for not staffing correctly very very good! chicken tikka for the non-spice lover & kadai veg for spice-lover me; mine was spicy enough with great flavors loved the pappadum really liked the roti & was less impressed with the aloo paratha (seemed a little skimpily stuffed) our order was taken by the guy who seated us (apparently not a waiter) who forgot to bring out roti & raita other staff were friendly informative & chatty next were trying the buffet lunch definitely better quality than most of the indian restaurants ive tried quality indian food but overpriced when it takes over an hour to get your food and you get it at the same time as the table that came in a half hour after you you know theres a service issue there was also a span of 25 minutes between all the entrees reaching the table i had to flag down the server multiple times to find out where our food was and to make requests they have a bar but its not stocked as they wait for their liquor license they should lower their prices especially with all these issues to make it worth the trip here although the restaurant is clean i suggest the chicken tikka masalato go the good part:look at the menu closely and some items will jump at you; im taking about the karaikudi chicken curry eral varuval (shrimp) and kerala fish curry not having eaten these dishes in recent times i was really excited to try them but then having been let down by so many indian restaurants in recent years i was very skeptical when it came to deciding whether or not to try one of these dishes i went ahead and ordered chicken curry and eral varuval anyway the wait was not long and i was pleasantly surprised at how well both the chicken curry and eral varuval tasted though both the dishes were toned down in their level of hotness they still retained their authentic taste and flavor the bad part:i went back a couple of weeks later and ordered the chicken curry and a dosa for takeout as i started eating the chicken curry i could clearly tell that there was something amiss about its taste it just didnt taste like the first time was it a quality or a consistency issue? going by my experience of indian restaurants i had a gut feeling that it was bothim not going to review/comment on other items (like chicken tikka masala or masala dosaetc) on the menu since a lot of them can be found at almost any indian resturant and they all seem to taste more or less the samenow coming to the weekday buffet which i can tell you straight up that it is very mediocre and not attention deserving at all the spread is limited and selection of dishes for a friday lunch buffet was very poor the taste was slightly off for a majority of items and the entire experience was a little disappointing im just hopeful that the weekend buffet is not the same this is one of my favorite indian restaurants! yummy! the malai kofta with the cashew sauce is divine the chicken tikka is really delicious garlic naan was a good choice and to finish it off the gajar halwa was oh so tasty the waitstaff is really running but still ultra friendly and helpful  my husband (who is indian) and i always enjoy ourselves,3.3333333333333335,6
NASHA Indian Cuisine,too many name changes in too short a time good decor now but foodwell theres much better in the valley weekend lunch buffet spread was limited in terms of salads and dessert and of the curries only 1 or 2 were good others were definitely passable server was friendly but thats cause we knew him from his previous two stints at two other restaurants in the valley naan and masala dosa - part of the buffet were good the chicken tikka appetizer was super dry and the sweet vermicelli was spoiled - the milk had curdled overall definitely passable not going back for sure went there for dinner on a tuesday night they were running specials - unlimited chaat + biryani + 1 dosa for like $9 the food was pretty good  we tried all the four chaat they had and the chicken biryani chicken tikka dosa was really good too the server aayesha was friendly and prompt with the service the owner seemed like a nice guy and chatted with us for a few minutes will definitely visit again went for the lunch buffet  nice decor and really lovely dishes and set up for the buffet  the server was friendly and quick to bring me my water  sadly the positives end there  the options for the food werent anything to get excited about with many of the hot dishes sitting empty  the butter chicken i had was tasty but the chicken tikka was dry (they used chicken breast)  also they had a delicious zucchini dish but it was barely lukewarm when it should have been hot  the garlic naan was very good but it took a long time for them to bring it to the table (i appreciate that they want to make it fresh but when youre half way through your meal by the time it comes its a little too slow)  the shocker came with the bill  $1099 for the lunch buffet  really?  for limited options and not that amazing of food kind of a disappointment  there are plenty of really awesome indian lunch buffets that are $899 that i will be going to instead (i know its only $2 but it just wasnt that great) meh,3.0,3
Minerva Indian Cuisine,heck yeah!talk about the system working!props to matt who started the awesome thread on yelp madison talk re: openings and closings (http://wwwyelpcom/topic/madison-the-official-2013-madison-openings-and-closings-comings-and-goings-thread) and thanks to steve for letting the community know about this new indian joint on junction rd (it may have taken me a few months to get her otherwise!) i was bouncing around the threads last night saw indian and got in the car (i called on my way to make sure they were actually open)folks this is easily the best indian food ive found in madison for three reasons:1 the menu holy cow its huge! i went for dinner and spent forever pouring over each and every page looking up a few items on my phone because they were new to me no shortage of variety here   2 the dosas this and this alone should make you speed over i think they have 15! thats nuts nuts! im used to seeing maybe 3 or 4 different kinds at a place3 the flavor everything i tried was incredible and although spice/heat is key to indian cooking theirs is well balanced and not so hot that you cant taste anything i had vegetable jalfrezi chicken tikka masala masala dosa and garlic naan all of it was awesome! (get these things!) even the garlic naan which i sort of feel like is tough to make incredible but it was incredible it arrived at the table piping hot and aromatic and didnt have an offensive garlic flavor the chicken tikka masala was some of the best ive had topping some of the curry i long for in london the veggies were tender yet crisp and in a super tasty sauce and the dosa ohhhh the dosa it was good not my favorite but with so many options i cant wait to get back and try another one maybe more adventurous than this one huge props to the stellar staff that made sure we had no questions about the menu kept water glasses full and told us they will have beer/wine/liquor soon (just wrapping up some paperwork) they also sent us home with leftovers in boxes and gave us extra rice very kind the atmosphere aint much so dont go expecting to be transported to india or anything there is some nice stuff hand painted on one wall but thats about it small space bright light no tunes playing the night i was there i didnt notice construction dirt or dust so im guessing they cleaned up after what sounds like a rushed opening and my feeling has always been if im there the first week im going to make a few exceptions anyway knowing theyre still trying to find their footing these guys have though and if food remains consistent this will be my go to for indian stuffs in madison! i am going to come right out and admit that im not an expert on indian food  i infrequently visit indian restaurants and the totality of my indian cooking experience is baking a couple batches of naan bread and cobbling together a presentable chicken tikka marsla  so if you are looking for the definitive review on the authenticity of the cuisine served at minerva this is not that reviewwith that said i felt my lunch buffet experience was a-ok  i thought the quality of the food was above average by buffet standards  the staff members were hard working and extremely cordialthings i liked:* the $995 lunch buffet offers an abundance of options  it took three trips to the buffet to sample everything (including the desserts)  the lamb curry the chicken tikka marsala and aloo gobi were standouts for me* the staff was constantly replenishing the buffet trays so the food in the buffet stayed fresh  (it helped that the restaurant was at capacity for lunch service)* loved the caramel custard dessert - that dish alone has me jonesing for a return visit* there always was a staff member near to the buffet to answer questions and to offer suggestions for dishes to try  the servers were extremely diligent about keeping beverage glasses filled and clearing dirty dishesthings i didnt:* the naan bread was a let down - it was too dry for my liking  i also did not care for the watered down coconut soup* the spartan interior of the restaurant is nothing to write home about  as corey d mentioned in his review it definitely will not transport you across the ocean to india  in addition the buffet is wedged into an alcove and it was difficult to maneuver through the other diners  * sitting near the front door during polar vortex season subjects you a cold breeze every time someone walks through the front door* for a cuisine known for its extensive use of spices i thought the buffet food was timidly seasoned  * it can be hard to understand the serversother observations and ramblings:* there was a line to get a table by 12:15 so come early to hit up the buffet* why is an indian restaurant named after the roman goddess of wisdom?  is it just me that wonders about things like that? yummy yummy lunch buffet! and a great value at $895 theres about 4 large buffet carts set up in the corner of the restaurant and they offer a large variety of indian offerings i think i tried just about everything and couldnt find one i didnt enjoy! their chicken tikka masala is so amazingi probably couldve had 4 plates of just that and been happy i also loved their chicken 65 ive never had anything like it before and it was delish they also offer garlic and plain naan as well as a sampling of many different chutneys and sauces wasnt too busy when i was there i was one of about 5 people dining in but the server was constantly taking plates and refilling water glasses! i think i can say that ive had better indian food but this place offers an awesome lunch buffet that i will definitely be back to enjoy again!,3.6666666666666665,3
Tandoori Times 2 Indian Bistro,finally a decent indian restaurant in phoenixand i have tried a lot of them!we went to tandoori times 2 from a recommendation of a guy i work with who is pakistani and is married to an indian woman (yeah i know their parents were probably ecstatic when they brought each other home)so we figured if he is recommending it why not?!we were pleasantly surprised we had some samosas chicken tikka palak peneer and vegetable biryani all came out piping hot and quite tastythe chicken tikka was tender and not at all dried out the palak peneer was excellent - a little sweeter than i am accustomed to but still very nice my son who is three couldnt get enough of the biryani - he kept shovelling it in and the samosas choolay (sp?) were very good! the sauce they brought them out in was just spicy enough to enjoy without overrwhelming the foodso 3 stars for the food and 1 star for the service our server omar is an asu student and he was great he said he is studying elementary education so he was really good with our sonwe will definitely be eating here again! btw while the restaurant is good for kids unless your child is able to eat spicy food - i dont recommend it in our case my son seems to be able to eat all the spicy foods his mom so loves so i am sorta new to indian food  i was introduced to it last year by my indian coworkers and i am hooked  this place is by far my favorite  i liked it from my first visit the waiter was helpful knowledgeable and put up with my indecisiveness  i have liked everything that ive tried here and ive tried a lot i usually go with my indian friends and therefore get to try new things that i might not have ordered for myself  my personal favorites are the chicken korma chicken tikka masala and some sort of shrimp dish that i dont remember the name of at the moment  they usually have a belly dancer on the weekend which is always fun to watch note: i have only been here once as my fiance isnt a big fan of indian food but i have been day dreaming about it ever sincemy friend i grabbed lunch here on a friday afternoon considering we went during what would normally be considered the lunch rush i was surprised that it wasnt more crowded but she had raved about their lunch specials so i was excited to try tt out we were quickly greeted with ice water and offered fresh brewed chai our waiter was great while he was new (he had just started a week before) but was friendly knowledgeable and seemed super enthusiastic about the foodwe decided to split an order of samosas to start wow best samosas that i have had ever the outside was cooked perfectly soft but crispy and warm the filling of potatoes and peas was creamy and spiced perfectly they were served with a garbanzo masala chutney that was out of this world seriously i could have eaten the chutney with a spoonmy friend had the lamb vindaloo which is the special on friday so she was served her main course a salad rice and naan this is the dish she had raved to me about and she seemed to be equally pleased with it the day we went i ordered the chicken tikka masala and it didnt disappoint the chicken was tender and the sauce was wonderfully creamy with just enough heat i also ordered a side of chili naan it was huge way too much for one person but was so delicious i wanted to eat the whole order i will be back and while i would like to say that i will try other dishes it will be hard to pull myself away from the samosas and the chicken tikka masala seriously check this place out this is the best indian food that i have ever had in arizona maybe even in the entire united states! the chicken tikka masala is to die for im used to indian food in london and anyone whos eaten indian in london knows that indian out here doesnt even compare! but this place is absolutely amazing! my mother (who is indian and a snob when it comes to indian food) surprisingly loved this place! whenever i tell her im going to tandori times she is very very jealous the staff is nice service is good havent been there when the bellydancer is there which would kind of irritate me only thing i didnt like was that one of the waitresses didnt speak english which was odd seeing as she was a server  i was just asking for a take away box and it seemed too much for her to handle decent prices a bit pricey compared to thai or pizza or something but its well worth itapart from the chicken tikka masala (that i order everytime i go) the eggplant dish is also very good as well as the lentils and the garlic naan this place is a must! due to the terrible service we experienced i should give this place 1 star but the food was delicious so im giving it 2 stars  four of us went here on our lunch break  note to self and others do not go to this place if you are pressed for time!!  our waitress had no idea what she was doing and messed up 2 of the 4 orders at our table  we were never offered anything to drink besides water and had to ask several time for plates once our food arrived  and trying to separate our payment was simply too much for her to handle  i will say my chicken tikka masala was absolutely delicious and is one of the best i have had in arizona  they do charge extra for rice which i find odd  the best part of ordering indian food is pouring the sauce over rice  the naan was excellent too!  the terrible service and extremely long wait time for our food as well as our check was unacceptable so i dont see us going back my fav is the chicken tikka masala and their seasoned ricetheir samosas choley is good w/ the red saucei will work for this stuff (frequneter)the gal that serves us water is super fast and efficientmy fav server is suaznne (sp?) shes fast outgoing friendly gets stuff donechicken tikka masala 1495seasoned rice 295 (?)samosas choley 695i blow my paycheque here cuz the stuff i order above is yumminessi like the open atmosphere of this placethey got belly dancing performances (dancer walks around shaking it while you eat) fridays 7:30 pm ishjust remember they are closed mondaysand have specific operating times for lunch (i think noon to 2:30?) the staff are very friendly herebut the chicken tikka masala has gone downhill since i last posted my reviewit got a lot more runny/ watery and lacks the flavor it used to havekind of disappointed bc it was my weekly fav dish summary:without claiming to be the arizonas foremost expert on indian cuisine or in fact even knowing what the hell im talking about; this is my favorite indian food restaurant the rice is never sticky the naan is always perfectly toasted and sacrilegiously tossing chicken tikka masala atop the two of em completes an excellent naan taco this review is pretty much giving that combination of items along with the chicken tikka wrap 5 stars i certainly cant vouch for the whole menupricing:the $695(?) chicken tikka wrap on the lunch menu is delicious lunch service is prompt dinner prices and portions are average indian food seems to always be in the $$ range minimumconcerns:if youre thinking about coming here on a friday or saturday you may want to consider calling ahead to find out if youre going to be subjected to shivas meal tarnishing minions the belly dancers along with the accompanying 100db indian techno soundtrack it only happened to me once and thank vishnu i was signing the bill at the time not much i can say other than this place is good and tandoori village is awful i had the lamb curry and my wife had the chicken tikka masala it was all wonderful i wouldnt order the paneer pakora again but thats ok itll save us some money like i said really really good im so disappointed in the decline of this restaurant i once loved the food here but my last experience was so bad that i havent been back we came for lunch and the place was nearly empty (that should have alerted me normally it was at least half full a few minutes after opening) we ordered id brought a friend who loved indian food and hadnt discovered this place she was very excited about coming and the free chai after ordering we walked over to the chai station and drew  two cups ugh it was watery milky and bitter it tasted old and not at all up to their normal standard i mentioned the poor quality to the server who was really trying to be helpful i even went over and got her a cup and she couldnt drink it she went to the back and come out and said the cooks dont want to make a fresh batch  whaaa?  so we dumped the chai and waited for our food i ordered  the chicken tandoori with garlic naan and my friend had the chicken tikka salad and we waited and waited and waited you could hear arguing for the kitchen not a good sign the server avoided us after 45 minutes i called her over  she said the food for coming  i drank a lot of water while waiting so off to the bathroom and on my way i pass a staff member leaning over a counter eating his lunch they just opened!? they had customers!? when the food finally arrived it ismehnot the quality i was accustomed to and not the place id bring anyone else for sure this visit was on march 15 2012 i havent been back since to a place that was once a regular once a month stop  oh yeah and my friend hasnt been back either  i honestly think it has a big management problem this place is fantastic! it is a bit of a hidden gem not easily seen from the road we got the chicken tikka masala (wonderful) and the curried chicken which i have dubbed the best ive ever had! we also got the naan basket which is several different flavors of naan we will definitely be going back food was amazing service was fantastic!! most authentic indian food outside of india!  i know because ive been!   dont let the idea of  exotic food scare you awaytheres something for everyone here even vegetarians and children!  try the paneer (pressed cheese) dishes or samosas choley if you dont like meat  try the chicken or paneer makhani if you dont like the heat!  for medium-spicy dishes the chicken tikka masala is excellent with a side of rice and naan bread!  if you want a bite of something thatll bite you back with a really great flavor try the tandoor fish wrap!  the key to eating reasonably is to go as a group of 2 or more get rice and naan and a couple different items to share with the entire table  you dont have to drink alcohol but theres a full service bar at all 3 of the tandoori times locations and the beer selection is above-average!  this is the 2nd of the 3 locations and features a nice inside area with a squishy but comfortable patio where you can enjoy hookah while you eat  bellydancers join the fun on friday and saturday nights  decent value if you crave very good quality food an exotic atmosphere and an authentic indian experience  ok the bellydancing isnt exactly authentic but its definitely exciting!  one of my favorite weekend hangoutssolid 5 out of 5! im giving them an extra star for their lunch specials which is an incredible value for the amount of food that you get this is my favorite indian restaurant in the area its right next to school! favorites include achari lambmmm so flavorful with no hint of gaminess and the lunch portion will feed you for several meals ive also had the chicken tikka masala which was good and chicken biryani which came with a huge side of raita yay! biryani is the food of my people (bengalis) so i am very picky when it comes to it id say tt2s biryani satisfies my cravings i also love to end my meal with their complimentary chai watered down some days good other days didnt care for the chicken tikka wrap lunch special thought it was too dry their naan is too doughy for my liking; i prefer mine light and a little crispy other than that i have no complaints thus far their decor is nice and their dinner prices are pretty standard for a nice indian restaurant their red meat is halal too! definitely will be frequenting this place! hands down the best chicken tikka in phoenix! as good as a middle of the road restaurant in england - in other words way better than anywhere else i have found in the valley highly recommend you try it service was ok tables etc are a bit downmarket but not offensive i was a little apprehensive about eating indian food in glendale - i lived in los angeles for years and had access to some pretty amazing indian food tandoori times 2 is located in a strip mall in glendale and is honestly pretty unassuming service was pretty good - our waitress was on top of things and kept our water glasses full and offered her suggestions when prompted for dinner we ordered the samosa choley: two crusty pastries stuffed with green peas & potatoes served with garbanzo masala assorted chutney - the pastry was cooked to perfection and the garbanzo bean masala was super flavorful and quite honestly the stand out of the appetizer we also had a an order of the plain naan and the pesto naan - the stand out winner was the classic plain naan! the chicken tikka masala was great - the portion was a little on the small size we ordered a lamb dish as well which was pretty good my favorite was the goat curry which is the special offered on fridays if your in the area and looking for something other than your typical tgi fridays than this is a great place to explore! we ordered chicken tikka chicken tikka masala (chef hot) rice and naan bread (with potatoes) and everything tasted amazing portions were perfect for the price our server was really nice very satisfied with our first visit and definitely plan to return!,4.0625,16
India's Grill,the other yelpers really nailed it no ambiance with the diner booths but the food is good and its family owned so you cant beat that  and the prices are great  we grabbed a $25 restaurantcom gc for $2 and i ended up paying under $30 including tax and tip for 2 chicken dishes a shrimp dish and two orders of nan  my favorite was the chicken tikka masala very flavorful  wish this place was closer to my house and/or was open later  but ill be back we discovered this place about six months ago via restaurantcom after trying virtually every other indian restaurant in gilbert chandler and mesa and not finding one that stands up to the great indian food we had when we lived in the bay areathis is by far the best here and comes closest to the amazing indian food we enjoyed in california  the chicken tikka and chicken tikka masala are outstanding as is the naan bread  the chana masala is quite good toowe only order off the menu (havent tried the buffet) and ive now been back dozens of times and have taken friends and family they all agree this is the best theyve had here in the phoenix areaservice is decent as well (nice family that runs it)  oh and if youre worried that indian food is too spicy for you just ask them to make it super mildthey are able to get it right and make it so i can eat it (and i dont like spicy food at all) i may bump this place up to 4 stars on my next visit  the presentation was very good the food smelled great the service was very goodmy criticisms are that the mixed grill was mostly overdone  not so much that it was bad it was very flavorful  but the shrimp was chewy and the lamb was overdone as wellthe garlic naan was awesome  the chicken tikka was very flavorful and was very different than other places ive had itthe portion on the naan was great less so on the tikka and the mixed grillthe place has a nice open layout and features accents of broken plates worked into the columns and other areas i have only eaten here twice with some friends and family i can say this though the chicken vindaloo was amazing i ordered it spicy the way god intended it; awesome! if youre a novice dont even try to order spicy though youll die also the chicken tikka masala was a little slice of heaven,4.0,4
Maharaja Restaurant E Pt Plaza,this is it - the cream of the crop  ive lived in the madison area for the past two years have visited many of the local indian buffets and have found none that equal the maharaja standard   buffet dishes change on a daily basis but you can always count on their show-stopping chicken tikka masala to be in the mix  in addition to the standard meat curries and tandoori chicken they always offer multiple vegetarian dishes and an array of appetizers  recommendations:  coconut soup vegetable korma malai kofta baingan bhartha chicken tikka masala mango ice creamthe staff is wonderful and always keeps plates of naan a plenty :)maharaja is by far one of madisons best restaurants  and you cant beat their lunch buffet deal (under $10)   but diners beware it is incredibly easy to overeat at this placeforcing one into an almost immediate food coma upon settling the check youll be treated like royalty at the maharaja i first came upon this place by chance i was in town for work and noticed that there was an indian restaurant nearby after reading the great reviews on yelp i knew i had to try it for myselfi ordered the chicken tikka masala along with naan bread and a cup of chai i ordered the food to be indian hot the waiter replied i like your confidence! it was very tasty and hot just as i like it the restaurant was well kept the staff treat the guests as royalty so the service is wonderful and the prices are decent for what youre getting  dont forget to stop by the indian grocery that is located next door to this location! it has a large selection of items so that you can make your own indian dinner at home will i be back the next time im in town?absolutely we did takeout and we ended up with large portions of excellent chicken tikka masala garlic naan and veggie pakora and they gave us free chai for the road! the food here is good my husband and i are new to indian food so i cant speak to its authenticity or how good it is in comparison to other indian food but overall we really liked the food here the chicken tikka masala was particularly delicious though there were lots of very good options at the buffet the naan was also good (and needed to cool the mouth every so often)the service was okay! nothing good or bad to say there the inside was really not all that awesome that was the major part that brought down the experience for us; it looked like it could do with a face-lift we went for the buffet on a sunday morning and are so glad we decided to give it a try!  my husbands favorite is chicken tikka massala - which they had on the buffet  im pretty new to indian food but there were so many options and so many things i liked!  the service was amazing!  our water glasses were constantly full which is good considering some of the food is really spicy!  were not from that area but if we were in the neighborhood i would consider going there again! my husband and i came today with a group of 14 people for their sunday lunch buffet and i have to say for the price excellent service and quality of food i really recommend this place!  i called ahead and they allowed our group to have a semi-private room away from the restaurant but close to the buffet  the buffet had all the dishes you would hope for and some unexpected ones as well!  i really enjoyed the chicken tikka chana masala samosa and more common dishesbut they also had a goat dish fish several biryanis really nice chutneys etc  my only complaint  about this place was that the naan wasnt in a basket with a napkin to keep it warmit was just plopped on a plate and got cold quickly  the naan was great and deserves to be kept warm!  the dessert section of the buffet had a ton of variety but the mango ice cream was superb  apparently when you order a meal during the week (even take away!) everyone gets a mango ice cream as well  the food was excellent but the mango ice cream will bring me back!,4.166666666666667,6
Zaidi's Grill,dont be disheartened by the initial cheap setting and weird/pathetic interior if anything thats authentic desi styling and sure enough it was a true sign of the good food to come little pricey considering the somewhat small serving sizes but tasted great! kebabs are very soft but everything was (thankfully!) spiced just right - not over or underwhelming my fav dish is always chicken tikka masala and though they flavor it with a slight twist it was great naan is nice n soft and sizes are big biriyani was a bit skimpy on the meat but the rice was good wouldve been even better if they offered raita oh one big warning the mango lasse - normally a drink i love - literally tasted diseased idk what it was but we all agreed maybe it was just a bad day for them? and at the time their kulfi machine hadnt come in that wouldve really hit the spot overall i left stuffed and happy :)btw props for the website and well-written menu if they can do those things well im sure they can carry that over to the interior designing aspect too really need fix the lighting change the pictures/decorations to something that make sense (the drums were a nice piece tho) the brown paint and spanish theme has got to go replace the jadoo box with real satellite desi tv and please upgrade the tables table cloths and chairs :)bottom line is you judge a restaurant by its food and this one delivers congrats on the new business and wish it much success!,4.0,1
Aachi Southindian Kitchen,so driving down elliott i saw this  place  and decided to stop  we sat down and the guy was so nice and attentive we shared the chicken tikka masala it was sooooo delicious! the service was incredible and wasnt to pricey the spices were perfect not too spicy i will definitely be back to try their buffet!,5.0,1
Noor Indian Takeaway,noor is definitely up there as one of my favourite takeaways they serve really traditional and authentic indian dishes which are of excellent qualitynoors menu has a vast selection of fine indian food which are very well priced at around six pounds for a main meal and you can see the chefs preparing your meal in the back i love their chicken tikka buhna which is full of flavour and spices  they also have met menus available which include starters a main and rice for just under seven pounds per person they also have a wide variety of vegetarian meals which are priced at under five pounds for a main course noor offer a home delivery service which i have always found to be extremely efficient and you can order either on-line by phone text or by popping into the shop itself the food is cooked fresh on the premises and it only takes about 10 minutes after ordering for your food to be ready they are open until midnight seven days a week so it is great place to stop buy for decent meal on your way back from a night out,5.0,1
Kismot,i am not sure why i havent done a review of kismot earlier as this is one of my favourite  restaurants in edinburgh i have been coming here for a number of years and i think this is due to the proximatey of the auld hoose - alternative music a couple of brews and then onto a curry cannot beat that of an evening for me onto the restaurant the decor has had a little bit of a face lift of late with some newly designed posters as has the menu not going to go into too much detail as previous reviewers have mentioned this but it is a good thing one thing that stuck me is the new additions to the menu - kismot naga pickle and iron bruna yep a curry with irn bru this is a family run restaurant and the sons greet you on the door with a bit of friendly banter you can see the other family members beavering away in the kitchen when you first enter  the food here is always up to high standards and our last outing was no exception we opted for the pickle trays poppadoms raitha and naga chilli pickle all washed down with lots of mango lassi the starter was great but the naga chilli in particular was excellent beware this comes with an 18 certificate warning and is very spicy the main courses were veg madras chicken masalla prawn passanda and chicken tikka north indian chilli garlic all were great their chilli garlic is still my favourite version of this disk in edinburgh one thing to bear in mind you get lots of rice and the nans are large so unless you ha vent eaten all day a rice and nan portion does 3 easily either that or it was something to do with the fact we order another jug of lassi but i dont think i ever come away as full eating any where else thumbs up from mefavourite dishes here:- mums desi khani homemade curry with limited availability worth a try if you are there at the weekend - mango lassi by the jug- bhindi- north indian chilli garlic- any of the madras dishes- naga chili pickle beware very spicy- methi - raitha,5.0,1
Gaylord India Restaurant,great restaurant with wonderful service  we decided to try this place out for a quick and casual dinner and loved it  i had been to their chicago location many times and was hoping this place would be just as good and it wasi had the chicken tikka masala with garlic naan and it was everything i wanted  the portions were just the right size and the sauce was delicious  the service was wonderful and surprisingly better than some higher end restaurants  we were seated quickly and never really had to wait long for anything  if i get a craving for something ethnic while in vegas ill be checking this place out! i cant believe this place doesnt have an off the charts rating!!!!omg this place is delicious i really messed up by this being the very 1st indian restaurant i had ever been to because it is such a hard act to followomg dont remember the name but the lamb stew thingy and the chicken tikka masalla is my favorrrrrittttteeee here this place makes the sauces just right ive tried several indian restaurants and none of them can ever compare to this or even come closethe sauces for the nan that they give are out of this world too!i kno it is kinda of expensive but when i feel like splurging this is my spot this was a nice escape inside the rio hotel/casino  the atmosphere is elaborate and we were greeted with lit candles and incense burning  it created a nice buffer from the casinorather than go with pre-selected lunch special combos we chose off the regular menu and ordered enough to share  the garlic naan was the best ive ever had  the samosas were flavorful and delicious - perfect way to start the meal  we shared the chicken tikka masala (didnt try this but my 3 companions loved it) mattar paneer (cubed farmers cheese and peas in a delicious gravy) beghan barta (baked eggplant with onions and tomatoes with spices) and aloo gobi (cauliflower and potatoes baked with herbs and spices)  all the flavors were rich and wonderful  my favorite was the cheese and peas followed by the baked eggplant  i love that indian food has so many flavorful vegetarian options  it was a fantastically satisfying lunch food is not all that the chicken tikka masala is not flavorful they are in a casino & they want people to be dressed up for buffet lunch especially when they are right next to swimming poolvery expensive  the garlic bread or roti is like $400 each service was slow and apathetic it really did remind me of india  the lamb vindaloo was not good at all i was thinking the chicken tikka masala was pretty good until about an hour later when i vomiting uncontrollably food poisoning for me and my buddy a gem of a location for great indian food  i ordered my favorite chicken tikka masala rice keema naan  everything was exceptional  food was hot beautifully cooked and service was fast without seeming pushy  the atmosphere lighting was subtle so potentially good for couples which i did see a few of in the establishment  i would go back there in a heartbeat if ever in vegas again,3.6666666666666665,6
Pyaar India Restaurant,this is a very tough review for me to write on our trip to pyaar the one good thing i can say about the restaurant is the owners are some of the nicest and most accommodating people you could hope to meet unfortunately i really didnt like my meal hereit should also be noted that this is a review only of the dinner buffet - its possible that ala carte menu ordering will produce a different experienceanyway when my wife and i discovered a new indian restaurant was opening in town we were pleased but the news that this one would feature an indian dinner buffet had us over the moon we are night owls by nature and during vacation times or on weekends we arent always ready to go in time for a lunch buffet - the chance of a dinner option for indian buffet sounded perfecttonight we went in with no expectations $999 or so per person for dinner seemed like a good deal although we were surprised that naan had to be purchased separately (its usually included with the buffet - this is the first time ive seen it as an extra)the selection was small and i ran into immediate problems im not sure if this is synonymous with the particular cuisine pyaar aims at - they claim to me the only north-south-mogul indian restaurant in vegas - but i was surprised at the presence of a couple of beef dishes the lack of any real main dish for vegetarians and nothing at all with the nice sauces ive come to expect from indian food no paneer dish no chicken tikka masala or chicken makhani no samosas no pakora no kofta of any sort  what i ended up with was the only two tandoori chicken drumsticks some of the very wet chilli beef some of the vegetable curry and a lot of ricethe tandoori chicken was fine if unspectacular and id have been ok to eat that and write it off as a notch in the belt but not somewhere i wanted to visit again but unfortunately the rest of the tandoori was thighs which i dont like the chilli beef tasted like a generic beef stew with a bit of chilli powder added potatoes were ok-ish but a bit hard in the vegetable currymy vegetarian wife fared even worse than me - ending up with some chick peas and a bit of potato on top of a bed of basmati riceby the time our naan (which tasted like a flour tortilla) arrived i realised that i had nothing to mop up as there was no dish featuring any of the delicious gravies i have come to associate with indian foodaround 3 minutes into the meal my wife pretended to receive an urgent phone call and we apologised and asked for the check the owners felt bad for us and were extremely nice offering to let us fill up to go boxes from the buffet and they waived the cost of the naan now perhaps its a different type of indian cuisine and its just our personal taste but we really didnt like the buffet here at all i feel bad having to pan this place so harshly because i really liked the owners but i hope if they read this review they consider some changes to their buffet because right now its uninspired bordering on inedible,1.0,1
Kebabish Original,having chomped down on various shish doner and chicken tikka rolls from various kebabish outlets over the years i have to concur with el tels viewpoint that this place is excellent as long as you stick to the kebabsand what kebabs they are stuck on a charcoal grill often right in front of you the proper barbeque taste is nothing short of fantastic the salad is fresh and if you avoid the doner a few of the grilled varieties probably arent all that bad for your health eitherhaving only tried a curry once it wasnt at the same level but the kebabs are what its all about what they want you to experience so grumbling about that would be like going to pizza hut and complaining that the pasta is shite which it isfantastic for kebabs and with their rapid expansion a testament to good old free market economics,5.0,1
Taj Indian Restaurant,i always get the chicken tikka masala and its always delicious  the staff is pleasant and i havent had a bad experience  the price is a bit steep but its worth it for the occasional dinner splurge first to arrive for the lunch buffet so the food dint sit for long literally had one of everything (i shouldnt be allowed at buffets) so i got a good sense of what they had to offer the good- pakora: the vegetable (cauliflower) was better than the fish or chicken crispy & well-seasoned- saag paneer: creamy thick & rich but not excessively so- kofta: nice soft texture good flavor well sauced- gulab jamun: not offensively sweet good texture- kheer: same as abovethe just okay- samosas garlic naan basmati rice were fine but unremarkable- watery dishes: chicken curry chicken tikka masala dal raita (would have been much better if the sauce had the consistency of the saag paneer)the wtf?- beef at an indian restaurant?! - no lamb- no spice/heat- bathrooms are kinda retro but not scaryi recently just got back from a trip to india (jaipur rajasthan) and the dishes listed under good above were comparable at less than $10 it was a great deal and will be back love this place!  i would give ten stars if i could and signed up for a yelp account just so i could share my awesome find with others  hands down some of the best indian food ive ever had    and i lived in india  great friendly and fast service in a cozy atmosphere  ive been for dine in dinner and take out and have never been disappointed  their prices are incredibly reasonable - i highly recommend the combination dinners - they have a vegetarian or meat combo that includes three curry-type dishes nan rice pakora appetizer and dessert for under $14!the chicken tikka masala is incredible - like everything else  they give you generous portions (enough for at least another whole meal at home yum)  the only draw back is that the are a little off the beaten path on s park but well worth the extra five or ten minutes out of your way amazingness i used to come here when i was at university and nothing has changedmy friends and i ordered samosas garlic naan chicken vindaloo chicken tikkamasala and chana masala no complaints very tasty now i noticed a few people complaining about the price but to cook these sauces and samosas at home takes more money than youd expect also its a lot cheaper than other cities bonus: $8 lunch buffetif you want some yummy indian cuisine try taj i go here when i dont go to the square for the other indian places always my favorites are the chicken tikka masala and carrot halwa the mango ice cream is always good the chutneys are varied but mango chutney is extra the naan could be better the only other negative is the restroom its unpleasant,4.0,5
Pasand,i love this place even though i live in gilbert; few indian places at all in gilbert will usually stop by when i go to trader joes and get the chicken tikka kebab thali style - thats enough for 2 meals for me (thali just means it comes with pappadums pooris rice raita lentils soup and 1 gulab jamun ball for dessert (two would be better)also love the onion pakora onion pieces deep fried in lentil batter service has always been friendly we entered through a darkened door into stillness not a soul to be seen my brow broke a sweat and my knees started to shake i feared we had made a tragic errorand that was the most exciting part of our visitwe sampled a variety: vegetable pakora papadum pooris naan garlic naan vegetable korma dahl sambar rasam raita chicken curry chicken tikka masala a tamarind/tomato sauce mint/cilantro/jalepeño sauce and gulab jamuneverything was spicy i would consider most of it mild but my poor spouse couldnt eat any of the mains she was stuck eating naan dipped in raitai found all of the dishes to be ok nothing bad nothing excitingthe chicken curry was fall apart tender and the galub jamun was very tastyi would eat here again but the are many other restaurants that will receive my patronage first my mom and i decided to have a girls day today starting with massages and ending with indian food on a whim my mom said that she hated indian food but then it came out that the last time she had had it was 20 years ago so we decided to give it a shot the place is dark and a little run down but once you get past that it is a decent place we split the chicken tikka masala thali with garlic naan and a mango lassi the drink was really tasty and my mom loved it! the chicken was good but it wasnt as good as i have had it other places and it wasnt that spicy the sauces that came with it were all pretty good for dessert it came with a little fried donut thing that was sorta chemically tastingnot my fave overall the place was good it just didnt measure up to other places i have tried but it did change my moms opinion on indian food which is awesome!,3.3333333333333335,3
Indian Paradise 2,if you own an indian restaurant you food has to be terrible or your service has to be awful to get a bad review from me  this place i found while driving to a customers house and needed to eat lunch after my appointment  they seated me right away and as usual i went right for the buffet and served myself a big plate  i love seeing how each place i visit makes their version of my favorite dishes which is almost everything on the buffet  this place however is the first place ive been to where they have a type of bread ive never had  its like a crepe with spicy potato in it  it was so yummy  try it all and dont miss out on all the staples; sag paneer chicken tikka masala chicken curry dal mak chana masala  enjoy! this place has the best chicken tikka masala around!  we have tried a ton of other places but hands down its the best! the lunch buffet was decent with standard indian dishes found in the other indian buffet restaurants i enjoyed the tandoori chicken tikka masala lentil and curry dishes all of which went well with their fragrant basmati rice i found the other dishes to be just ok including the limited dessert options service was friendly and the place is clean and spacious - not suprising for a building that used to be a black bear diner,4.333333333333333,3
Mount Everest India's Cuisine,i took the family for the lunch buffet and it was the best indian buffet in las vegas   i had been to just about every indian buffet in town before getting a recommendation from a friend  the place was clean the food was well stocked and the fresh naan thats included with the $899 was excellent   particularly good was the chicken tikka masala  since my kids liked it i will be going back there often when i saw mt everest getting ready to open i was initially a little put off by the locale - in a defunct burger king building next to a gas station in a grotty parking lot outside mariannas mexican supermarket on west sahara eventually we tried the extremely reasonably priced lunch buffet for $895 and were immediately blown away by the quality and variety of food here i am a meat eater and my wife is a vegatarian but there is so much for both of us the chicken makhani and chicken tikka masala (these two rotate so you will get either one of the other) are both wonderful and theres always a few delicious vegetable dishes that are cooked and seasoned to perfection vegetables that i would never consider eating elsewhere are somehow transformed into pure delightsalso excellent is the selection of pakora and the large delicious samosas (i usually manage to polish off three of these)freshly cooked naan (so fresh you almost burn your hands if you arent careful) is so good you could make a meal out of it and some of the sauce from the buffet alone our hosts usually offer us our choice of plain or garlic naan - or even both they are eager to please their customers here at mt everestquite often i can tell when an indian restaurant is going to be good by the number of indian people eating there - mt everest attracts a diverse mix of clientele yet does not fall into the trap of becoming too westernisedif i have one small criticism it is that gulab jamun (a personal favourite) never seems to appear as the dessert on the buffet but this is an extremely minor complaintthe dinner menu is extensive with as many as ten options for each base type of food (veg chicken lamb etc) at dinner you get a free serve of papadums along with well priced servings that were a good 30% cheaper than in some of the local competitor restaurants and possible twice the size - extremely good value and the dinner time butter chicken could be the best i have ever tastednote: you might want to look over all 1 star reviews of mount everest (and for that matter all vegas indian restaurants) with a critical eye youll notice they are often from people who have written no other real reviews i strongly suspect theres some review wars going on between different establishments youll notice they will always claim that staff are rude disrespectful etc - there isnt an indian restaurant in vegas i have been to where the staff have been anything short of gracious to the point of humble and mt everest is no exception dont believe the bogus reviews that claim otherwise fail to understand the yelp hype here very standard north indian restaurant solid and in the top half of that category but not 5 star by any stretch only a couple of nepalese dishes vegetable chow chow was kind of lame just a few chopped peppers and onions there are too many indian restaurants bringing the same menu and they all blend together india is a huge country (especially when youre including neighboring countries like nepal) and it has a vast variety of cuisines and styles somebody please bring something more adventurous than saag paneer and chicken tikka masala o happy dayswhen on site at my client in las vegas i cannot wait for my lunch break so i can jet down to mt everest india cuisine for my much needed indian food fix i became aware of this place after searching yelp for an indian restaurant and have never looked backthe restaurant is just a couple of minutes away from my work site so the lunch buffet works out really well i can immediately sit down order my plain naan bread and start dishing upthe food is always flavorful and there are always very many options to choose from they take care of the vegetarian and the meat lovers between us i take particular joy in the chana masala at this venue - a delight which is shared by one of the waiters who told me this a while ago :)i love the fact that i can go back to scoop some more of any indian curry with which i can enjoy the remainder of my naan bread i have ordered a chicken tikka masala take out with mt everest before and that sparked off my must have mindset with which i now approach every trip to las vegasi confess that i will easily come here more than once per single work week because that is how good the food is and as for the price - you will hardly ever convince me of better value for money elsewhere i love indian food but we usually go to india palace so when i got a $25 off coupon we decided to try them out! i am so glad we did!  their prices seem to be slightly lower than india palace and their portions were definitely much largerwe had the vegetable samosa to start- it was a tad salty but with the two chutneys they really balanced outwe also had:chili naan- was good not spicy at allchicken tikka- same as tandoori chicken but boneless it was good some pieces were a little dry but overall pretty good  i dont understand the french fries on top thoughthat kinda threw me offhmmmlamb vindaloo- delish  lamb were actual pieces of lamb not the ground lamb like some places use  very flavorful not too gameyaloo matter- potatoes and peas in a sauce again large portion and large chunks of potatoesoverall- everything was excellent medium spice still gave all the entrees a little kick  i just asked for hot sauce on the side to add to my food since i really like it spicywill definitely be back next time with my daughter as i know she will really enjoy it!  no butter chicken on the menu but think ill try the chicken korma next! the bf and i came in and we were sat down immediately with some ice water and papadams with chutney as we browsed the menuwe decided to get themt everest special ($2199) which comes with: mixed appetizer salad papadam chicken tikka dal makhani palak paneer lamb curry chicken tikka rice naan raita for dessert gulab jamun and chai tea  we did not really get what was on the menu as we didnt get salad or our dessert but kheer rice pudding instead i didnt realize this until looking at the online menu for this review either way- its alot of food but would have been nice to get what we ordered the mix appetizer was some grilled sausage chicken tikka pieces a samosa and little papadam bites it was a very big plate and was super filling the main dishes were decent with the paneer being my favorite my one thing was that the paneer and the dal needed a bit of salt but still good raita was more tangy and watery than most ive had but was good to dip my naan in the kheer was very nice and not too sweetchicken korma ($1299)- entrees come with rice it was decent but was more yellow curry flavor than other kormas ive had we also got some garlic naan ($299) thinking that there might not be enough naan with the mixed plate but if we didnt order this the plain naan would be more than enough the amount of food for two people with that is crazy we had leftovers which i had for two separate and still very sizable lunches we would have been very full and satisfied with just the mixed plate but we had a restaurantcom certificate to use service was okay they started off good with drink refills when they came to drop off food after a while they were doing tasks and seemed to be really into it towards of our meal so we sat there for a while needing things overall the food here isnt my favorite indian but decent it definitely is the most value large portions than any others ive been to another lunch favorite!  ive been several times for lunch and always eat at the buffet  the food is delicious; theres various traditional options including basmati rice samosas chicken dishes (eg chicken tikka) dal makhani and other vegetarian dishes  theres also fruit  the buffet actually has a good variety of food  my absolute favorite is the sweet rice which is orange colored and has peanuts (or cashews?) in it  i have a sweet tooth and love rice so this is the best of both worlds for me  im not a huge meat eater but am not vegetarian either so i end up loading up on the sweet rice    my runner-up favorite (or actually maybe tied) is the naan  whoa nelly the naan is always warm and soft  we always get a basket that has plain naan and naan with garlic  the garlic naan is super good  although im sure its a huge faux pas i love getting the orange marmalade from the buffet (for the fruit) and putting just a little on the naan  thats my dirty little secret at mt everestoverall its a great place to have lunch  its generally busy or at least half way full  i think it also feels a little nicer because the tables in the center of the restaurant have linen table cloths  oh! and another plus -- they usually have a bollywood movie playing on a flat screen tv above the buffet  the sound is not on or is low but its fun to watch nevertheless! mt everest is a great find and we were really impressed with the caring service from prakass and food  we had chicken tikka masala (fabulous) we were eating the sauce by itself when the chicken was gone rogan josh (lamb) was tender and no fat  the naan bread was fluffy and crispy  im not a beer drinker but our server prakass suggested that we try the indian beer taj mahal  loved it the food portions are generous as well   will definitely return local celebrity yuhi k recommended mt everest to me and oh boy was she right? oh yes im a brit we know  or think we know everything about indian food we grow up eating the stuff there are more indian restaurants in england than mickey ds really! would i embellish? maybe but i dont think so in this instanceanyway friday night and the kids ditched us outrageous i know but gives wifee and i a rare chance to eat what we want yuhi k recommends a place down on sahara i explain who is yuhi k? asks my leader  she knows about food i explain unconvincinglyit is a long drive down wsahara from my hood and wifee is viewing my choice with suspicion  it will be great i proclaim be patient mteverest sits in front of a slightly rundown strip mall but parking is easy and my expedition was a successwe were greeted promptly and offered a table or booth booth the greeter/server guy seemed to be the owner he was great recommended a great beer taj mahal 15 pints of frothy cold delight wifee grabbed a nice cold chardonnaywe started with a mixed dish of samosa kebab chicken tikka and some other stuff fantastic and more than enough to sharemains: i had a mushroom lamb dish i am asked how spicy i would like being a big shot expert indian food eater  i asked for 7/10 too hot! im such a wimp after many years away from blighty really quite pathetic i tell my server/owner/guy no problem! he took it away and brought it back re done at a more acceptable spiceness ( im pretty sure thats not a word sorry) delicious! served with rice and a garlic naan wifee has chicken saag she ordered 6/10 on the heat scale perfect!water was always topped up drinks were offered frequently really great and we are going back often thanks yuhi k!!!!! have eaten the lunch buffet here at least 15-18 times over the course of 3 years and i must say that mt everest is finally in its prime i immediately sensed a new chef 2 visits ago and my guess was confirmed by the owner the owner was visibly excited about the new chefs contributions smiling and describing all of the new dishes tastewise and lookswise the buffet has never been better it costs $1 more than before but it is worth it the sambar soup is perfectly seasoned the new dishes (chicken chili vegetable korma) are colorful and tasty and the overall spice level is kicked up one notch closer to a straight-up medium the chicken mahkani is masterful and complex - as good as some of the best chicken tikka masala-type curry ive tasted the dal mahkani is a 3 or 4-bean variety and is much improved over the previous chefs version great samosas and aloo vegetable varieties very importantly the buffet console is boiling hot so all of the food is steaming hot and remains hot on your plate several minutes after you sit down at your table this is a huge detail that can make or break an indian buffet mt everest nails it - keep it up! business seems better than ever which is a good sign that im not the only one who feels like this food has gotten really good typical to an indian lunch buffet the fresh-baked naan and roti are complimentary but the whole wheat roti is especially good here - one would expect it to come out traditionally thin and flat but the mt everest version can be mistaken for a puffy naan bread - a nice surprise whole wheat roti has taken the place of white basmati rice in my indian lunch dietbuffet plates and bowls are clean and shiny water glasses are refilled constantly every single visit finished plates are picked up quickly overall service is great my only warning is you may smell like indian food for the rest of the afternoon so if you are on your way to an important meeting in a small office space maybe bring a change of clothing if you are self-conscious about that kind of thing i guess this is proof that when you eat the lunch buffet at mt everest you are immersed in a cauldron of indian deliciousnessgo now and get it while its hot! ive waited this long to write a review because if i really care about a place i want to make sure its right before friends go try it for the first time (see my cravin cajun review) being indian and all i can cook indian food fairly well but i seek out indian restaurant for the beautiful diversity of regional specialties that i just dont know how to cook or do not have the equipment to cook (eg tandoor oven) in the 3 years that i lived here i have yet to find an indian restaurant that blows me away but mt everest is one of the better ones came here on a saturday night around 7:00 pm not the best looking place from the outside but still hopeful this was a diamond in the rough the parking lot was full however surprisingly there were only two other tables filled however towards the end of our meal the restaurant filled out  my husband and i got there before the other couple joining us (it is one of their favorite restaurants)  the staff immediately greeted and seated us  we had a few moments to look arounddecor is a bit dated with the dark green upholstery but well kept  we ordered a bottle of wine from the limited but reasonably priced popular wines  once the other couple arrived they were immediately recognized as familiar faces by the staff  prior to ordering we were served complimentary papadoms with the tradition mint and tamarind chutneys we ordered tandoori chicken as an appetizer this is a great value given there were atleast 8 pieces  it came out sizzling hot serve on a cast iron skillet  i wanted to love it as its sight and sound captured my senses but it was missing that aromatic smell  that is right it was not aromatic or flavorfulkind of bland for tandoori but nothing offensive and definitely well prepared  still worth getting because it comes out fresh and sizzling just spritz with lemon and sprinkle  salt it is more than fine  shortly after our main dishes came out--palak paneer chicken tikka rogan josh garlic naan and a side kachumber salad  first off the portions were plentiful and more than enough to feed four hearty adult appetites and two for lunch the next day  the palak to the palak paneer makes that dish silky creamy and very comforting but could use a bit more spice although it was ordered at a level 6 on spice scale (1 to 10)  the chicken tikka was tasty and familiar in the sweet tomatoey stylei prefer it slightly less sweet but again well made and worth trying  the rogan joshs flavor was complexly layers and my favorite dish; it almost like my moms!  however we ordered it at a level 10 spiciness but it was much milder than expected  although i dont eat bread according to my fellow dinners the garlic naan was fresh warm and soft   the kachumber salad was standard  throughout our meal  the manager/owner(?) kept checking to make sure we were satisfied and of course asking if we wanted more wine once we finished the bottle we order  he gave us generously filled glasses for $5 and we had a friendly conversation  overall the food was prepared with quality ingredients and with care but lacked a bit of seasoning  i havent returned to many indian restaurants in vegas but i am sure to return to mt everest because the food is good well priced and the manager and staff is friendly a special combination lacking in most indian restaurants per very positive yelp reviews a couple of friends and i stopped in here one evening and very glad we did! food was amazing & service was excellent! we ordered saag paneer chicken tikka masala and garlic naan- all phenomenal (and i eat quite a bit of indian food) our server which i believe was also the owner was incredibly nice and sincerely thankful for our business such great service seems hard to come by these days so this place really made an impression on me id recommend it to any one in town craving something other than hangover pizza ;) excited for leftovers tomorrow! im normally not a fan of indian food but this place is am-az-ing! we ordered a ton of food and gobbled it down like vagabonds who had been starving in the desert for centuries i highly recommend the chicken tikka masalla and okra dishes ps: you definitely cant judge this book by its cover i love this place!  ive eaten here many times and theyve never disappointed  the food is delicious - i almost always get the chicken tikka masala but the chicken tandoori is to die for (spicy without being too much) and the naan (ive had garlic and regular) is fabulous  really all the food ive had here has been excellent!i also love their lunch buffet  its a good deal at $1099 and there is always great variety  ive been able to try many things that i would have never ordered (goat curry - yum!) but there are also always some of my favorites  their dinner menu is reasonably priced (especially with a groupon) but the lunch buffet is definitely the deal to get if youre in the area at lunch timethe first time i went the location was a little scary - its on the corner next to a gas station and marianas supermarket and the outside is not super bright  i was a little nervous but as soon as i stepped inside i felt much better  it is a cute place - tablecloths on the tables well lit (not bright but definitely not shady) and the people are so nice  ive always had excellent service - definitely the nicest servers ive had in a long time!i definitely highly recommend mt everest! first let me say im not a vegas guy if i never came back here id be happy and trying to get a decent affordable meal on or around the strip is a nightmare if youre being wined and dined then by all means have the sales manager take you to whatever over-priced bellagio restaurant you see fitif like me a great meal in a quiet place is what youre after run dont walk to mt everest prakash and the fellas serve up some of the tastiest indian cuisine ive ever had dont let the neighborhood (its quite safe) or the former pizza hut exterior deter you as soon as you walk inside it feels like an oasis and the delicious smells of curry and tandoori greet youthe chicken tikka served sort of fajita-style was tender and delicious and spiced to perfection the saag paneer one of my favorite indian dishes was savory and so inviting that i kept going back to it as i filled in the corners at the end of the meal when id already eaten too much we also had their lamb curry which was not a ground lamb curry but featured a generous portion of cubed lamb shoulder perfectly cooked and tenderthis is my new go-to spot in this ridiculous town mount everest is fabulous! this trip to vegas my husband put the kabosh on expensive strip restaurants so after yelping the best off-strip restaurants we decided to see what all the fuss was about the bottom line (in case you dont wanna read on): food so good we came here 2 days in a row dont let the neighborhood scare you only a lil sketchy the food is spectacular!! best indian food we ever had ever we tried the mt everest thali which was plenty of food for 2 big eaters the naan is yummers- both plain and garlic even the lamb which im pretty picky about was so tasty not gamey at all our favorite dishes: chicken tikka masala saag paneer we came back for the lunch buffet the day after i highly recommend it if you like variety and dont really know the names of the dishes there wasnt a single thing we didnt like not only is the food amazing but service is great prakash is a great host we will be coming here every time we come to vegas i went here to convert two of my girlfriends to try and like indian food and it was a success a classmate of mine told me about this place she said this is hands down her favorite indian restaurant in the city so after a couple months of persuading my two friends who arent so adventurous in cuisines as much as i am finally decided to accompany me to mt everest id admit the venue is a bit sketchy but i just kept pulling the two inside i already know my favorite indian dishes so i ordered for my friends since they dont know what dishes are what we went for chicken tikka masala korma and tandoori i thought those dishes were the most friendly to those whove never had indian food before so yeah we also got garlic and regular naan combination and mango lassi (my favorite!) i liked every dish we ordered especially the korma i cant stop dipping my garlic naan into it and the lassi was just perfect i wanted to drink a whole pitcher if i could the service was very friendly and he didnt hesitate to help us with any questions regarding the dishes in past experiences with indian restaurants i felt like the service have been quite rushed and somewhat rude but mt everests server was quite congenial i think the prices arent bad and the serving was enough for people to share i think ive found my go to indian restaurant ill definitely try their lunch buffet let me start by saying that the food is delicious (on most days) my review will be covering my lunch buffet experience only so please keep that in mind when readingpros:plenty of variety - chicken tikka tandoori chicken saag paneer and so forth the naan is freshly made but be sure to mention custom requests such as garlic naan etc while you are being seated (or they assume you want it plain)conswhile the food quality ranges from good to excellent the customer service is lacking depending on the season the owner is a really chill guy but he seems have 1 person working all the tables sometimes (which gets chaotic during lunch rush and customer service suffers)  ive noticed hes hired more staff lately but i suspect its only seasonal my note to him - keep your location well-staffed :) i love their carrot dessert (gajar halwa) which is light years better than the sugary gulab jamun they have a salad bar which is decentmy advice to readers - you better make sure you are leading an active lifestyle if indian buffet is your goto for lunch although the food here is tasty delicious goodness its not really good for your body :/ authentic indian food isnt this greasy or creamy and most indian people dont eat like thisbecause of the health implications of eating such loaded items i tend to go there once every 2 weeksmaybe once a month i have eaten at everest many times the aloo muttor gobi chicken tikka masala chicken biryani garlic naan and more the owner and staff have  consistently been helpful i will be returning soon my favorite indian restaurant (gaylord) is now out of business and other indian restaurants ive been to have been mediocre which is why im so glad i gave mount everest a try eventhough the place was kind of creepy  the quality of the food is comparable to gaylords but you get more food and pay a lot less  the people that work here are very nice and friendly  they have bollywood videos on at all timesthey give you a basket of papadum with mint and tamarind sauces  we started of with samosa (theyre like potato-filled empanadas with ginger and spices) and aloo tikki (fried patties of mashed potatoes in chick pea batter)mango lasi:creamy mango shake 5/5veggie samosa:you get two pieces for $4  the crust was the right thickness and wasnt too doughy  you can definitely taste the spices  i had to use the tamarind sauce to tone down the heat a bit very filling 4/5aloo tikki:you get 2 patties for $4 crispy deep-fried mashed potatoes  very filling as well  great flavor 5/5palak paneer:i was looking for the cheese on top since thats what im used to  4/5garlic naan:i love this stuff  we had 2 orders hot garlicky and buttery bread to scoop/dip saucy dishes with 5/5chicken tikka masala:my favorite indian dish  we ordered mild but it was still quite spicybut it burned so good 5/5kulfi:a mild cheesy ice cream and you can see pistachio bits 4/5gulab jamun:my favorite indian dessert theyre like hot cheese dougnuts in simple syrup 5/5i honestly wasnt expecting the food to be that good  this is my new favorite in vegas!  they also have a lunch buffet from 11am-3pm for $10-11  id come back here for that! being spoiled with californias many indian restaurants i was sad when i came back to las vegas to find a very limited selection of places to get my chicken tikka masala and garlic naan cravings taken care of i thought the only way to get my fix was to fly back to the bay to get it but then i came across this place!i have probably driven passed this place a billion times before i considered to try it and honestly it wasnt until i saw the awesome ratings from yelpers before i decided it was a go boy am i happy i did! everything on their menu is so flavorful and rich! my boyfriend and i looooooooove this place its inside of what used to be a burger king in front of the marianas supermarket the area isnt aesthetically pleasing but dont you dare judge a book by its cover! their service is hospitable kind of quiet and shy but hospitable nonetheless their mango lasse is amazeballs their chai is alright probably wouldnt order it again though the papadams (spelling?) and the little sauces that get served before you order are so dainty and delicious! if you ever come for their lunch buffet dont plan on eating for the rest of the day haha! they have an awesome selection and everything is fresh! were so excited that we found this place the boyfriend and i were talking about how we dont know why indian food has such a negative social stigma when its actually delicious but i guess we dont really mind more for us! :) modest atmosphere - great foodi went with a couple of friends while in sin citygarlic naan - fluffy and garlicy - yumsamosas - solid not amazing mint & tamarind chutneys were really goodchicken tikka masala - outstandingchicken kardai - really goodlamb vindaloo- great flavor - lamb a bit toughsaag - great flavorrice - niceowner couldnt have been nicer his son even drove us to the closest hotel to catch a cab because it would have been more than 30 minutes for one to comeget off the strip and get some real indian grub here i visited this restaurant last night while in town on a business trip based on previous reviewers from yelp i was glad that the outward appearance of the restaurant had been mentioned as it may have kept me from going in if i had just been driving by once you enter though its a great environment with the white tablecloths and napkins as someone dining alone i particularly enjoyed the bollywood playing in the corner it kept me entertained while i was waiting for my food which was an excellent break from the standard of playing with my phone i ordered the chicken tikka masala which is my basis for judging a restaurant (much like pad thai at a thai restaurant) the sauce was amazingly creamy and had a slow burn to it which i find the hallmark of a good sauce i want the spice but not at the expense of the flavor the naan was perfect with a crispy edge and soft center ideal for sopping up the sauce but even more than the food the service was phenomenal everyone is very friendly but give you your space my water never got below half-way full and i can put away water like a camel so thats impressive and when i had a problem they were endlessly gracious and worked with me while i figured it out few restaurants would take the time or effort to come up with a mutually satisfying solution the way that they didend result: if i lived here id weigh a million pounds because i would eat here all the time as it is ill have to settle for stopping in every time im in town yum! the first time we came to mount everest was a year ago when we were in vegas  it was so good that when we came back to vegas this year we put it on our list of things to do  im still trying to find an indian place in az thats as good as this one if youre a fan of chicken tikka masala you have to try it at mount everest  its the best that i have ever tasted and im just sad that i have to come all the way to las vegas to get it  it was even better than i remembered and i ate way too much just because it tasted so good i didnt want to stop eating it  the garlic naan is also delicious  the service is friendly and attentive and the location cozy (in a good way)  i wish i could buy the food in bulk and ship it to az!  well be back for sure  if youre in the vegas area looking for great indian food this is the place to be! we decided to try this place based on its pretty consistent yelp reviews and were glad we did a few reviewers have mentioned the sketchy surroundings but i say if you can throw some carpet a few tablecloths and the drapes from an old bordello into a defunct burger king and come up with a perfectly comfortable dining room more power to ya! i have loved indian food since i first discovered it during a brief sojourn in london when it seemed that the only options were steak and kidney pie or starving to death (i chose the latter valar morghulis)! anyway as a person who considers curry to be more of a drug than a food im usually prepared to like what i get in indian restaurants which is a little meat floating in a sea of delicious sauce which you happily sop up with some fluffy toasty naan and fill up on the rice(im getting hungry again just thinking about it) the difference here was that there was plenty of tender juicy meat in that sauce; apparently a side benefit of keeping the rent low hope they dont get too big for their britches and move to summerlin goodbye meat! i adore chicken korma and theirs was perfect; rich creamy sauce with just a little sweetness and those complex spicy undertones that keep you coming back for more bites long after youre full chicken tikka and tandoori were both served sizzling and still moist and juicy the favorite appetizer in a unanimous vote was the lamb samosas they were golden little pockets of pastry stuffed with seasoned finely ground lamb but the best thing was what wasnt there: my sister didnt find a hard thing mind you if there is ground meat involved be it burgers sausage meatballs whatever she always gets the hard thing and the rest of us have to suffer along with her its one of lifes little miracles that she didnt and practically worth a sixth starwill definitely return to try the lunch buffet but dont be surprised if they raise the price after our visit i feel drunk after dinner not because of drinks but with all the great spices they have on the food we had chicken tikka masala and prawn vindulo with garlic naan the flavors were all great especially the masala i think its the best one ive ever tasted the portion size was also just right compared to the other indian restaurants ive been too the only downside is the service thats why im giving it 4 stars the servers were very nice but they were short handed they need more people there we will be back for sure! another favorite in vegas definitely the best indian in town! ive been to the lunch buffet and the a la carte dinner while the buffet is certainly worth the price i love coming for dinner so that i can order exactly what i want! the garlic naan is a must and i recommend it with some plain yogurt on the side! for main courses i really love the lamb (or vegetable) korma and the chicken tiki masala i get both on medium (5) level and it still has a good amount of spice!! id say those two sauces are my favorites since ive tried others that are not as memorable to me i dont love the chicken tikka but probably only because im a big sauce girl! i also really enjoy the okra vegetable dish! full of flavor!though the talk of slow service is true id say the food is too good to pass up and dont mind the service i also like to finish my meal with a chai tea at the end overall great place eating so many delicious spices just makes me feel very warm and calm on the inside i would definitely consider this comfort food i drove all away from utah to have their chicken tikka masala with garlic naan incredible!  best combination of spices i have ever tastednot only was the food amazing but the service was incomparable!i will be making the trip just for this restaurant you wont be sorry! had a craving for indian food and mount everest was recommended by my cab driver started off with a chicken tikka plate that came out looking great because it was sizzling but after a closer inspection i noticed it was doused in red color dye and no marination or flavor i then had some butter chicken which had too much spice and not enough flavor i did enjoy the naan bread however which was fluffy and soft needless to say- i did not take the leftovers superb!!!!! this food was so full of flavor and the owner and his son were wonderful hosts! we were in vegas for my birthday and i was craving indian food so i looked on yelp and found mount everest when we first arrived we were greeted with a smile and seated right away just by reading the menu we knew we were in for an amazing food experience we ordered somosa chicken tikka masala and tandori chicken the food was absolutely outstanding! the spices and flavors were a little spicy but too good to not eat!! since we left vegas i have been craving the same experience but have not been able to find something remotely close literally the best indian food ive ever had we decided to give it a try for my friends birthday after reading lots of positive reviews here on yelp and upon arrival we were seated immediately everyone elses food smelled so good when we first walked in i was really excited even though i dont typically care for indian food we ordered a bottle of wine and a few various dinners and naan which we did wait a little while to actually receive but it was so worth the wait everything was amazing! i had the chicken tikka masala which i would surely order again the owner was also there making sure that everything was perfect he even brought my friend out dessert for her birthday :) we will definitely make the trip back across town to eat here again this place is absolutely amazing before i get to the food i want to say how nice the waiter was i think he was the ownera son and he was so nice and funny he just came over and talked to us and wanted to see how our food was and if we were doing okay and now the food! we ordered the chicken tikka masala chicken jal frezi and dal tarka with basmati rice for the main course all were very tasty and the chicken was so tender for dessert we got the sweet balls and the rice pudding omg both were soo good! oh and of course the garlic naan was amazing! i definitely recommend this place! a little underwhelmed by the much-hyped chicken tikka masala ordered take out added on the garlic naan and galub jamon specified a spice level of 5/10 for my tikka and order was out in 10 minutes flat with a large side of basmati ricechicken tikka masala was a good size for the $13 price tag which included the rice garlic naan was worth the upcharge: delicious soft and flavorful with a garlic scent that wafted through my car as i drove home my disappointment came when i finally tried my entree for a spice level of 5 i tasted absolutely no spice and the sauce had a sweetness to it that i am not familiar with it wasnt necessarily bad but the dish didnt have the kick to it i was craving chicken in dish was in large chunks sauce was a smidge on the thin sidebased on other reviews im going to have to come back for the lunch buffet and reevaluate after wanting to try this place on my last couple visits to vegas i finally made it there on monday the husband and i literally drove from phoenix straight to mount everest for the lunch buffet this buffet was no joke the food on it was very good we both felt it was one of the best indian buffets we had been to so much so that i ate a ton of food and couldnt eat another thing for the rest of the day standout dishes were the chickpea curry the sweet rice (never seen this before!) and the warm carrot dessert so tasty! the chicken tikka masala wasnt the best id ever had complaints include: we finished a full plate of food before getting the opportunity to ask for naan (they didnt bring any to us) our booth was in a weird corner you had to squeeze into and their womens bathroom wasnt super clean (although i imagine that was from a recent customer and not due to a general lack of cleanliness) i would recommend this place to locals for sure one of the best indian buffet yet!  excellent food selection and display ! samosas and chicken tikka masala tandoori chicken sweet rice lentil chutney naan are 5 stars!!! and try chai tea too!! for $10 this is an amazing spread! restaurants clean definitely made it onto my fav lunch spot list ! very tasty reasonably priced indian food (especially considering the cost at some of the other restaurants and resorts in vegas) we made the drive from henderson and it was worth it -- chicken tikka masala and lamb korma were both tasty (but had kick! i had to order a mango lassi to quench the fire) attentive staff and easy parking - just be aware it might feel a little sketchy in that area but we had no problems get the garlic naan too! we eat indian food a lot and are quite particular  i am pleased to say that this restaurant exceeded my expectations in all respects   i like that the owner and his family work together and are very service oriented  of course the food is why we would go and again it exceeded our expectations  clearly the best indian food in las vegas  the chicken tikka masala was excellent as was the lamb vindaloo  big menu making it hard to choose and i found myself looking at all the great dishes coming out if the kitchen  try and get there early to get a booth as it looks much more comfortable than a regular table  highly recommended and we will be back soon with our friends,4.513513513513513,37
Delhi Palace Cuisine of India,ive been eating at delhi palace for years and  it is pretty decent north indian food nothing to blow your doors off but good enough the lunch time buffet can be hit or miss but when it is on it is oh so good tandoori chicken tikka masala palak paneer garlic naan and pakoras are some of my favorites they also serve a hot tea and i am not sure what it is called but it goes really well with the spicy foodwhen i am not dining for lunch the mushroom bhajee or seafood tandooris are  my dishes of choice dont fool yourself into thinking the veggie options are going to be good for you most of their dishes are loaded in cream ghee or paneer so diner beware it is easy to pack in over 1000 calories in a sitting make sure to top it off with a flying horse lager this beer is so good i usually order one to go! i love indian food! and ive had a lot of indian food regularly though out my life in many countries delhi palace cuisine serves very good north indian food its as simple as that it is reasonably priced tooi went there for dinner with a few friends of mine after one of them boasted ill take you to the best indian restaurant in phoenix! hes probably rightwe shared the food so had the beef biryani which was very good the chicken tikka masala which was great its a creamy dish as its supposed to be but they didnt over do it as some places do so dont feel guilty about ordering it the tandoori chicken was excellent and im picky about tandoori chicken they have  a decent vegetarian section but i only tried the palak paneer & it was some of the best ive had; even though its not usually my type of dishi didnt like the ice tea though it tasted like it had some special spice or something but serves me right for ordering ice tea at an indian restaurant the garlic nan was good toothe atmosphere is typical for lots of indian restaurants it doesnt feel like a cafeteria or anything like that but its not going to impress anyone or wow your date but its comfortable relaxed unpretentious and true/authentic to the type of restaurant there were a few indian couples around; always a good signthe service was excellent; they didnt interrupt the conversation as ive found happens too often in us restaurants these days but they were always there; prompt ready to serve & respond i didnt feel rushed eitherin a nutshell if you want to experience tasty authentic north indian food and enjoy your meal & company check this place out im definitely coming back hello my name is jeremy and im an addict i am never going to quit! my stomach is blind and loves all foods today indian! delhi palace is very good i have enjoyed every dish if you are a beginner i truly recommend a dish called chicken tikka masala it is a real starter dish and is a mainstay on almost every indian menu it is fragrant creamy rich and warming it is not spicy thats just a tip for newcomers for foodies and ethnic eaters do try the karahi goat very hot it is delicious vegetable korma quells the heat a little the paneer here is some of the best i have tasted fresh firm and creamy daler mehndi the punjab pimp is humming beats in my head now i must go  my food has arrived oh i love when reps bring me free lunch  please do not forget the naan i hope you enjoy i have yet to find a better mix of service and food at any indian food restaurant the place is dark cool and the food is incrediblepalak paneer - good for your vegetarian friendschicken korma - sweet and savory flavors in a creamyyellow saucelamb boti kabab - the onions will melt in your mouthchicken tikka masala - tomato base with a little kickgarlic naan i could go on and onhave the papadum and ask for the mango chutney as your appetizer if you are so inclined the veggie samosas are delicious with some of the tamarind sauce drizzled on top have some indian tea to drink but save room for the kheer for dessertthey are also good for to-go orders and its usually ready in minutes! we went here tonight for dinner and the whole experience was just a notch above median we picked this place through yelp and though we cook indian food (im indian) at least 3 days a week sometimes we crave for restaurant indian food we ordered the mixed grill plate for appetizers and chicken tikka masala and naan for the main course the mixed grill plate comprised of kabobs (both seekh and tikkas of chicken lamb and beef) laid on a thick bed of sauteed onions and a couple of lemon wedges it arrived sizzling hot and several people turned their heads to see where that szzzzz sound was coming from!  i dug into it with my mouth salivating in expectation but it was a rude shock the chicken was dry to the mouth the seekh kabobs were overpowered with spices (mainly red pepper) and the quantity--so abysmal! the bed of onions probably weighed more in quantity than the meat the tikkas were standard fareoily and spicy gravy with cubed pieces of chicken the place is good for students because its so close to asu but otherwise i dont think i will go back there again! i spend allot of time at the tempe improv so i go to the delhi palace for the lunch buffet which is located on the south side of the building across the street on university the lunch buffet is open from 11:00 - 2:30 so if you like authentic northern indian cuisine this is the real deal for $895 and the best part is you dont have to whip out the sun brand tandoori powder and make it yourselfi normally do not like buffet food that has been sitting under a heat lamp for any length of time but if you arrive early at 11:00 when they first open there is a good chance your buffet food experience will be a good one i believe the food on the lunch buffet is not spicy on purpose to appeal to the masses which would make since i personally prefer my indian food spicy with some burn and im sure if you order something off the regular menu they will kick it up a notch for youthe delhi palace is home of the masala they have chicken tikka masala garam masala chana masala chaat masala tandoori masala and even yogurt masala the only masala missing off the menu is penn masala the worlds first hindi a cappella singing group formed in 1996 by a group of students at the university of pennsylvania deep down i must believe asu is working on their first hindi a cappella singing group but heck thats another storymy personal favorites here are the tandoori chicken chicken korma palak paneer chicken tikka masala and the garlic naan bread if your into indian beers you will like the fact they have taj mahal and flying horse royal lager beer i normally drink the hot chai tearepeat after me can you say green mint chutney delhi palace is hands down one of the best indian places in tempe only beaten by royal taj (which is truly wonderful and i suggest you try it)the service is so-so half of the service men dont come by regularly but there is at least one guy who is super attentive and does pretty well about re-filling drinks and finding out if you are doing okive had many of the dishes there including their chicken tikka masalla tandoori chicken chicken and lamb vindaloo the garlic naan is fantastic the best dish of what i tried was the tikka masalla the vindaloo is off somehow it used to be my favorite dish back in san francisco but i havent found an indian place here in tempe that does it right however their masalla is amazing that sauce with garlic naan is mmmmmthe decor is very authentic so is the smell of the restaurant as with a lot of good indian places it can get kind of cloying but if you are into the indian culture and food you can easily get past it this place is one of my favorite places to eat at while in tempe (sadly i dont go that often since graduating from asu)  ive eaten here many many many times so that tells you im a fan i go back for the same reasons - very well made great tasting n indian dishes such as the keema mutter (ground lamb) chicken tikka tandoori chicken and their gulab jamun and rice pudding is super tasty  i know how to enjoy this place without pigging out (1st round of proteins 2nd round of vegetables skip the bread and rice 2 gulab and im set!) though i do leave quite full but not regretting it  their service is good and ive never had any server issues nor food issues for that matter  they are consistent in flavorful n indian food and service (i went 2 weeks ago and was impressed with the fact that nothing had changed!) so thats why im a fan excellent chicken tikka!! we used to drive 20 minutes just to eat here umyes please! this is one of those cases where the idiom you cant judge a book by its cover really applies this place looks awful from the outsidelike a place you would never want to go but do not be fooled! i went here yesterday with my dad and brother for the lunch buffet and it was killer! there was a wide variety of dishes including chicken tikka masala (my fave dish) a spinach curry a vegetarian meatball in curry a stewed goat dish (which was ah mazing) and even desserts and chai tea they also come around and bring naan to your table all for like 9$ per person! the food here i thought was really really good and for the price you cant beat it ive paid double or more to eat at some other indian restaurants around tempe and i can honestly say that this was just as good if not better than those places (plus the variety of a buffet is nice) i will be back here for sure! been to this place probably about 5 times for dinner i dont like buffet as much so i cant say much about it you can order from the menu at lunch also if you prefer that over the buffet their service is really good the food is good also my favorite dishes are the chicken tikka massala and the vegetable korma along with naan its one of the best indian food restaurants ive tried around the valley probably the best out of 4 ive tried i am reviewing this based on the  chicken tikka masala  i havent ordered anything else on the menu and i really dont think i need to  this dish is fantastic!  i have been to this place multiple times and if this is an accurate description of indian food than i am a fan! the tandoori chicken was overcooked and dry the chicken tikka masala was a bit too salty they serve garlic naan and give you free chai tea so that was nice,3.923076923076923,13
Tadka Sizzles,i picked up some indian food from herewe had the lamb biryani and a couple of the curriesthe biryani was good but not as spicy as i had requestedthe curries (chicken tikka masala chicken curry etc) were okay,2.0,1
Curry Corner,really great food: the chicken tikka masala was spicy but not overpowering and the meat was cooked perfectly lovely flavor! the mango lhassi was also quite delicious the only downside was the wait i had called ahead so the order would be ready but when i showed up i still had to wait about 15 minutes but they were really busy which is a good sign so maybe it evens out im definitely going back! one day after work  i decided to visit the curry corner with my friend and i was a little skeptical to try the food because i have tried a lot of average indian food and i didnt want to have that experience again but i noticed the food was pakistani stylesince i had chicken twice that day already i wanted to order a beef dish the guy at the counter told me that they were out of beef  then i decided to order the most popular dish the chicken tikka masala    it was a different kind of indian/pakistani dish that i am used to usually these kind of dishes are heavy but this dish was very light but flavorful at the same time  the naan bread was different as well it was a lot lighter and fluffier then the usual naan bread; the rice was pretty good toowe ended up paying about $10 bucks a person i would like to pay a little toward the $7-$8 range for this kind of place because they dont serve you but $10 is ok overall i would recommend this place if you are looking for a change of pace when it comes to indian/pakistani food and want something lighter but flavorful at the same time this place is awful! the chicken tikka masala is not flavored and it tastes like the sauce is campbells tomato soup the tikka masala fries were soggy and luke warm at best the service was lacking and the place wasnt even busy! i would drive the 2 miles to the dhaba and never look back! best of phoenix 2011 yeah right! definitely thought i had reviewed this place before but i guess noti had tried their catering before and it was pretty good so i decided i would try their restaurant foodbad idea i ordered chicken tikka masala and got chicken tikka soup the masala that was there was super watered down and the chicken was a mix of white meat and brown meat some of the brown meat was so tough that i had to leave a few pieces of the chicken uneaten the naan was really good but the chicken tikka masala was very sub par to make matters worse it cost a whopping $7 when $7 gets you much more food at other places i doubt you are going to venture back here i suppose it was worth a try but its not worth the return i like this place its close to campus for a good price and good portion sizes i like their yummy chicken tikka masala! they give you a good portion sizes the other dishes were pretty good samosas were ok their curry is tasty and the food isnt that spicy super love their tikka masala fries yeah i said tikka masala fries! theyre currently undergoing renovations to make the place a bit bigger and its needed since it can get busy and full oh man!  rarely do i hand out 5 stars but this place is an exception  first off dont be turned off by the crummy strip mall its in or the tempe trash that loiters around outside scratching at their coke bugs or the fact that u-turns and left-hand turns are a pain in the ass off of apache due to this light-rail set-up - you must open your mind!the guy working tonight was either the owner or son of the owner or something but he knew customer service  he was welcoming friendly informative diligent with cleaning up taking and bringing orders and answering the myriad of questions i threw out at him (like is the lamb leg or shoulder are the bones included?)  this guy knew his food (we shared our goat meat sources and cooking tips) and described everything in a very detailed way  i sure wasnt asking lots of questions to be picky no in fact i was wanting to learn how this $9 goat dish i had was having such an effect on me oof!  best friggin $9 ive spent so far this year!!!  i could eat this all day!out from the kitchen where a pakistani woman was cooking came a size-able stainless steel container with this wonderfully aromatic succulent goat meat in tomato and garam masala stew it was fantastic!  i love that they used the fat renderings with the garam masala to make this *heavenly* soupy deliciousness that was plentiful in the little container damn im salivating just remembering it all over againso check out this place  the guy was awesome but what stood out the most was their flavorful goat dish the goat being the stand-out!   my sisters chicken tikka was also super flavorful but mine was definitely more complex and interesting now i just need another excuse to go to tempe so i can relive this! i went here last week with a large group (6 people) we ordered 5 dishes including two orders of chicken tikka masala goat curry chicken achari and palak paneer overall we all (including one friend who is indian) thought it was not the best indian food we have hadthe tikka masala was alright but wasnt as rich or flavorful as other tikka masalas i have had i did not care for the chicken achari but i have not had that before so it may just not be something i like in general the palak paneer was alright but again was somewhat bland the goat curry in my opinion was the best thing we had it had a lot of goat flavor (which i like) and was generally tasty the meals all came with either rice or naan but disappointingly the rice was plain white rice (no spices in it like most basmati rices) and the naan was also plain still nice that it was includedwhich brings me to the reason this place is 3 stars and not 2it is soo inexpensive! we each paid six dollars and change for all of that foodmost places would be well over 10$ each so that is worth an extra star all on its own i probably wouldnt come here if you want amazing food but if you want decent food on the cheap this is your place! i had high expectations for this restaurant after reading all the great reviews on yelp and it did not disappoint my friends and i were a bit apprehensive because we are not exactly indian food connoisseurs but the server helped us order our dishes and we were very pleased with what we got all the curry was delicious and it had the perfect amount of spice to it just enough to make you reach for the water but not too much that you lose the taste of the food the naan was delicious and the portions were perfect for sharing with the whole party i think we had the chicken makhani chicken tikka masala one of their goat specials and the vegetarian thali plate which was a big sample plate of a bunch of different foods oh and it doesnt get better than only paying around $8 per person and being so full you can barely move lets just say i am jealous of everyone at asu who can frequent this restaurant on a regular basis i love this place like ive said in other reviews im a student so i appreciate a deal im also a foodie and have expensive taste so i love when the three can come together on rare occasions and bless me with great food! i love indian food especially pakistani and punjabi im still trying things on the menu but so far the chicken tikka was flavorful i wish i wouldve gotten their wonderful saffron rice with it instead of the regular basmati but saving money it tasted just as great the aloo palak potatoes with sautéed spinach and spices was a great vegetarian meal and went perfect with rice and their great garlic nan i also had the the goat biryani and though i loath bones the meat and saffron rice with the rendered fat from stewing made it worth the extra effort of getting through the many bones (that is to be expected with any goat dish at many ethnic restaurants and is part of the dining experience) very well done dishyes the atmosphere is laid back but the owner caters to us college students and that keeps the cost down i think theyre the most reasonable indian restaurant in the valley that alone will keep me coming back the service is good laid back as well the owner is very kind and attentive again the food is great so ill be back often you should definitely pop your head in and start with some nan and let your mind wander through the many choicesthey even have daily specials like halal kung pao chicken one day not sure whether to give this place 3 or 4 stars  i eat there 1-2x a month and they consistently have some of the best food in this class  and they consistently have the most mediocre service  i dont use this word often but the young ladies that have worked as wait staff since i started eating there way back when would best be described as ditzy  tonight i had a delicious chicken tikka masala and some hummus both excellent  i was also going to have a mango lassi but it never arrived i also had to ask for a plate and getting that had to ask for silverware  when i ask for a napkin i was told they are on the bar on the other side of the restaurant  are you kidding me? so i had to leave my food and all to walk across the place to get my own napkin  im a consistent 20% tipper at a minimum  i know how hard wait staff work in most place  this one tonight again i felt i was being generous in leaving her 2 bucks oy vey! i know a lot of people who love this place but i dont get it  they are going to be featured on the food network as having the beset chicken tikka masala  i ordered this twice (thinking maybe the first time it was an off day) but it was horrible each time  not tender or tasty the goat tastes like lamb and has that grassy taste  and the nans are served on these plastic trays where they dont change the foil between customers!   bathroom is filthy  lots of college students eat here and it is in walking distance of asus campus  its not even that cheap  i must be missing something because i do not recommend this place i went back last night  had to  there is no better chicken tikka masala around it was superb as usual along with the garlic naan and samosas   and im please to report that the service this timeunlike almost every visit before was very professional   im not a college student and wont just be ok with any kind of service maybe college students arent either  she was attentive took my order promptly brought everything i needed to the table and checked on me 2-3 times during the course of my solo dining  very well done indeed  i just hope they can keep up this level of service because it matches their food now!  nuff said we know good indo-pak food (having grown up on indo-pak food gives us some credibility) and on our 1st visit the whole group left raving!! the kharai goat was finger licking good! seekh kebabs were so flavorful! the afghani boti was grilled to perfection the chicken tikka masala was ok and the mango lassi was so refreshing!!! we will be back to curry corner for sure!! worth the 30 min drive from so chandler:) i ordered 3 items to go one of which was chicken tikka masala and  i didnt get it we were charged for it but we got a beef dish with lots of bones i was pretty disappointed i dont think i will be back!!!!!!! amazing chicken tikka masala just as good as my favorite indian restaurant back in philadelphia if youre near tempe you should really try curry corner and get the garlic naan best chicken tikka masala nice and spicy i order the garlic naanmy husband gets the biryani  and hes always happy with iti used to eat inside but our last 4 visits my husband orders take out the owners son (part owner?) is nice and helpful i love ddd and always check out his picks when in the area seen this on tv and decided to see what all the hoo-ha was all about normally guy is pretty good with his choices but sometimes he can be off a bitinside is rather small and appears to be a hit with the asu students as well as the regulars who live or work nearby there are two tvs that are always on and either playing the food network or a cheesy flick from overseasthe menu has a several choices to pick from when ordering some are more pakistani style while others are more of the standard favorites that you would see for this type of restaurant cuisinestarted with a some appetizers ordered the samosas with dipping sauces and on another visit some aloo tikki had to try what guy had eaten so got the goat karahi with garlic naan and then came back again later in the week and tried the tandoori chicken tikkathey definitely got the flavors down but the portions seemed rather small really liked both the goat and the tandoori wish that you could order a larger version of the meals without having to pay for two dishes i had asked if i could get the tandoori with more chicken for an extra charge and i was told that was not an option hmmm?give them a try and make sure to fill up on the appetizers first so that you are not still hungry when you are finished prices are reasonable until you end up ordering more than what you were expecting thats money!325 stars my workgroup came here for dinner standard hole in the wall decor we found prices to be reasonable our portions were way too much for one person the chicken tikka wings were awesome they also had tikka masala fries something different unique never had it before but still tasted american flavor so didnt go well with the rest of the food also had nehari lamb curry and chicken handi all good but nothing special great food briyani chicken tikka lamb curry etc i will be back you do not come to the restaurant for the atmoshphere nor the service it is 4 stars because service was bad sure the fishtank looks gross and the decor is far more shabby than chic but nobody comes here for the ambiance the food man the food is incredible there isnt a bad thing on the menu the cheese naan is so wrong but so right the chicken tikka masala is on point and the goat biryani is so tender and flavorful people have to stop judging indian restaurants by how they make chicken tikka masala or any tikka masala for that matter yes chicken tikka masala is an indian dish but it is not the only indian dish hell its a north indian dish that seldom gets any attention in other parts of indiai choose curry corner over other indian restaurants in this area because of its positive reviews i ordered a lamb biryani and a chicken curry to-go was told the order would take 15-20mins so i sat at one of the tables and patiently waited the place was not busy and almost everyone who came after me got their food served while i was still kept waiting finally after more than 35mins of waiting my order was ready and i was told the lamb biryani usually takes time to prepare so i thought maybe biryani was worth the waitinitially the biryani looked good but when i started digging into it was when i realized how badly it was prepared the biryani was just rice mixed with some curry and a few hard-to-chew lamb pieces thrown in trust me it tasted awful i simply dont understand why some indian restaurants have this compulsion to include a biryani on the menu when they dont know or even have the faintest idea about how it is preparedand as for the chicken curry it tasted ok; nothing great - just mediocre curry corner is another indian restaurant serving mediocre indian food to susceptible locals what a shame! stay away from curries they are watered down friendly people cozy atmosphere all i tried was chicken tikka masala and its not up to par service still bad but i keep coming back because the food is excellent try the tikka masalla fries it is different and i love it chicken tikka masalla is still the best ordering the food to go is the bet option took me forever to finally leave the comforts of phoenix to check out curry corner  my only regret not coming sooner!  super close right next to asu  fast friendly service  some of the best garlic and cheese stuffed naan around  had the chicken tikka lamb biryani and of course a mango lassi  like many family owned gems the décor isnt fancy  i was a little worried that they would rest on their dd&d laurels like some restaurants do but i am eagerly looking for another excuse to head back and check out the rest of the menu i am a big fan of curry corner they have the best indian/pakistani food in tempe i am a big fan of the chicken tikka masala palak paneer and all of the lamb dishes the biryani rice is also a favorite of mine and of course the naan is also delicious best indian restaurant in tempe for reasonably priced and great food its located in an eyesore plaza and is desiring a face lift inside but that being said the food is amazeballs! try the chicken tikka masala :d my husband and i are auditioning new indian food places since our favorite royal taj will be closing soon i figured curry corner would be a good place to startwhen we arrived the owner sat us at a dirty table and didnt even notice the debris it was the gentleman who brought out our water later that seemed to be embarrassed by the mess and immediately wiped the table i got the vegetarian thali so that i could try a few different dishes at once and my husband got the chicken tikka masala since its a good comparison dish our food came out fairly quickly although my naan lagged behind a few minutes at least it was fresh and hot though very plain the dal and chickpeas were the standouts in my dish tons of flavor for something so simple my husband was happy with his chicken he said the meat was tender and the sauce wasnt overwhelmed with cream like at other places he was hoping for a bigger portion but for the price it was a good value the basmati was decent but we prefer the more spiced version from our usual placeservice was really lacking though we had to ask for water my husbands entree didnt come with a plate no one checked up on us after the food arrived we had to ask for the check we observed other patrons who got wrong orders or orders that were forgotten altogether the misspelled t-shirts worn by the staff in expensive excellence really irked me too i would try curry corner again but i might stick to takeout seriously am i missing something??? i seem to be the only person who has had better indian food  the fam and i decided to give this place a try even though it is very far from home but with a recommendation like ddd what could go wrong?  well first off its a bit chaotic when you walk in  no real system to be seated and the tables are weirdly situated  once we were seated we were rushed to order thankfully we mostly knew what we wantedi tryed the marsala fries which were by far the best thing we ate  those i must say are amazing  i also had a bite of the samosas which were ok not really that favorful and the chicken tikka masala  honestly it was ok but ive had better even from trader joes  we also had the goat this too was ok better than the masala but so fatty it was hard to eatso long story short if you live near here then perhaps hit it up  otherwise check out some indian food closer to home that is my recommendation  youre welcome i make a habit of visiting food network locations and usually they are just as amazing as the show sayscurry corner is just ok  ive had indian/pakistani food all over the country and this did not stand up to the hype on food network  ive been there 3 times and have had the chicken tikka (featured) the tikka masala and the aloo saag  the chicken tikka was great but the other two were the exact same dishes youd find at any average indian restaurant  the food has also been luke-warm every single time like it had been sitting for about 10 minutes before being brought out  food-wise this comes nowhere near the really good indian places ive beenits not bad but not great eithernow onto the service which is where most of this review score comes from  the customer service is terrible  everyone working there acts like they have no idea whats going on like this is their first time in a restaurant and they dont know how it works  my party of two had to wait for 15 minutes before being seated and there were only 2 other families in there  they gave us literally 10 seconds to look at the menu before very briskly asking for our order and then looking offended when we said we needed more time  the food took way too long (and like i said felt like it had just been sitting) and the check took even longer  we didnt have a consistent waiter different people kept coming over to us and i really got the impression that they dont have any type of consistent system for waiting on their guests  in general everyone working there acts like they dont care that you came in and are deciding to spend your money there  it makes me not want to come back  curry corner: if you are reading this go hire a consultant to come in and show you how to run a restaurant  you really really need some help with thisthe restaurant itself is shabby and the tables and booths are arranged really awkwardly  its not particularly clean or festive looking and the fish tank is really really dirty  i could see into the kitchen and that didnt look very clean either  there is no music playing and it makes it way too quiet and awkward in there  sadly i dont agree with guy fieri on this one  you can find better food and better service at other indian spots in phoenix pretty good+ located in a strip mall next to a tattoo shop lots of parking which is a plus+ staff are friendly and restaurant is clean- bathroom isnt so clean+ food is good and not spicy if you have a sensitive stomach i think it could have used more of a kick though to be honest- flavors are solid but maybe a little watered down id have to try more dishes to really say for sure+ chicken tikka masala is a safe way to go if youve never had indian food+ reasonable pricesill be back so we finally checked this place out based on guys recommendation on his show and i really just dont get it we ordered the garlic naan rice biryani chicken tikka masala and the chicken korma the curries were both very thin and lacking the depth of flavors i am used to the chicken korma really wasnt that good at all - the tikka masala was better but still not that great i was really disappointed! the biryani was ok but lack luster the best was the garlic naan probably there are many other indian restaurants that are far supreme to this one (sorry to say) although i am fine with dives this place does need to work on its appearance inside it just seemed not clean not going back sorry,3.3870967741935485,31
India Palace,best chicken tikka masala ive encountered its also one of the few places that ever has dosas readily available and the service is goodsince moving to the bay area ive noticed that india palace is a bit pricey for indian foodbut considering that it tastes better than all the indian places ive gone to here in the bay id say that its worth itlas vegas lacks a variety of quality ethnic places luckily there are few places like india palace that make up for it well i had tried origin india tamba bollywood grill and india oven none of them compare to the tastes of india palace that i experienced in oct 2009 everything tasted great from the mango lassi to the chicken tikka masalathe only negative was that the waiters indian accent was very thick and he tended to speak quickly so he wasnt always easy to understand - even for a well traveled person like myself still im yet to find a better indian restaurant in las vegas i dropped in with a buddy for the lunch buffet it was ok  the fare is standard for an indian place lamb curry chicken tikka masala naan bread  heres a tip if you offer a buffet dont bother offering salad if all youre going to have is iceburg lettuce and canned fruit  im glad they honored the 2-1 coupon for the buffet and the service was polite and good last night in vegas:my girlfriend and i wanted to eat somewhere off the strip and have some good indian food we are both glad we found this place ok it may not be in the best part of town but the food more than makes up for itappetizers: complimentary flat breads with dipping saucesentrees: lamb curry & chicken tikka masalasides: keemon naan and plain naaneverything was oh so good i dont really eat too much indian food maybe because im worried that im going to get bad indian food but im glad we went here first thing you notice when you walk in is that everyone that is sitting in the restaurant is indian! ok so theyre all indian this place must be good! and yes it was for sure we are going to have to go back here again if and when we are in vegas sunday night: january 10 2010 indian food heaven my bf yelped this place while we were thinking of a place to grub my last night in vegas before heading back home monday morning when we first walked in i thought wowtons of indian customers and wowvery classy spot we started off with some flat breads and a couple different dipping sauces very delicious! for our entrees we ordered the chicken tikka masala and the lamb curry and of course being total mcfatties we ordered 2 different types of naan bread ohhhh how i love naan and ohhhh how they made them just right! and to finish off with dessert we ordered some indian ice cream i had the pistachio and he ordered the mango very different but very good as well the service was also quite excellent i definitely didnt think wed find an awesome indian restaurant as this one that night definitely gotta try this place out if youre ever in vegas and looking to dine off the strip so diamond palace in diamond bar ca had the best chicken tikka masala as of yet  well i have finally discovered (so far) the winner of that title  it now belongs to india palace in las vegas nv!  it is located a mile east of the strip  the neighborhood seems run-down but the restaurant is beautfully decorated and modern-looking  the flavours of the chicken tikka masala were perfect  i ordered mine spicy and it had just the right amount of kick  it was unanimous within our group of indian food-lovers that this was the best place weve had yet  the waiter recommended the rice dish pea pulao which contained white basmati rice peas yellow raisins and either peanuts or cashews (cant remember)  he said it was more special and flavorful than the regular rice  it was good also but i prefer the plain rice  the naan was perfect as well (but who could mess that up?)  i am sad that it is so far away because i cant eat it often but luckily i visit las vegas a few times a year and it will make it that much more special to anticipate eating it  i will never hit the casino buffets anymore and opt to go to india palaces buffet instead! now thats money well-spent!! i had a hankering for indian food and had been meaning to try india palace i grabbed a friend and we headed on our way as others have said the neighborhood is a bit sketchy the restaurant is nice inside and looks recently renovated the staff was extremely friendly and seated us right away the food is good really good they immediately brought us papadum and a few various sauces we ordered some garlic naan (delicious) and the bombay fish (decent)we ordered chicken tikka masala and reshami chicken along with two orders of basmati rice i ordered the tikka masala as spicy as they make it it was spicy but i wanted tears and didnt get any it was still delicious its the best indian food ive had in las vegas during the 5 years ive lived heregreat service great atmosphere and great food go! this is the 2nd best indian food ever! weve been to the middle east and had true indian food and experienced the full cultural effect anyhow we live in orange county ca and eat here every time we come to vegas which is pretty often! weve tried numerous places close to home and have found nothing that comes even close to india palace we always leaving enjoying the food of other establishments since we love indian food but it always feels like something is lacking we always get the same items: papadum served with various sauces -you get this for free right when you sit down garlic naan chicken tikka- its all white meat with onions and peppers!! chicken vindaloo- extra indian spicy peas pulao simple easy and delish! the place is clean and the service is warm and friendly without being overbearing nice decor and very clean the servers need to take some training on etiquette but they didnt mean bad the chicken tikka masala was tasty for sure but a small portion for the money goat biryami was bad  gulab jun was yummy let me start by saying this was my first time having indian food  i was a little worried because im not too sure i like curry  didnt think i would like indian food but my mother-in-law wanted to do the lunch buffet for her birthday  she and her husband spent a year and a half in indiawow!  with the exception of some chick pea salad thing i liked everything on the buffet and i basically tried everyting  the chicken tikka marsala or butter chicken was so yum  my mom-in-law called around trying to find a lunch buffet with this dish and only india palace had it so score!  i also really liked the spinach  not sure what was in it but it had a spicy kick  there were also these vegetable fritter things which were great  sorry i cant be more descriptive but i was overwhelmed!the service was great  i believe the owner was waiting on us and he talked to the in-laws about india and really made it a good experience  cute decor  parking is tight  overall i would definitely recommend this place yum yum and yum!  the garlic naan is to die for!  i had the chicken tikka masala and it was absolutely delicious india palace has been voted best indian restaurant in las vegas by the zagat survey every year since 2001 and it has been described to me by indians as the most authentic restaurant we have ive dined there a handful of times to see if i agreealthough i wouldnt normally want to hang out on east twain one of the citys most dangerous areas i will always take unnecessary risks for good food the restaurant sticks out as the only kept up interesting piece of architecture in that area so its hard to missyou will forget about the exterior surroundings upon entering as the decor is immediately welcoming the walls are painted in warm cheery earth tones that are beautifully complemented by heavy amber drapes and rich dark woods there is a comfortable full-service bar you can enjoy a drink at before your meal making india palace stand out from many of its competitorsmy favorite thing to get here is the dosa a thin pancake made from chickpeas it is of such great diameter that it must be folded upon itself so it can almost fit on your plate and it is eaten by tearing off more reasonably sized pieces the only other place ive seen dosa is at india masala in the riviera (same owners i believe) so i highly recommend ordering it here you can have your dosa stuffed with an incendiary potato filling or get the plain papper dosa which i prefer (both $1095) it is served with an addictive coconut chutney which is more like a coconut puree and sambar a tangy tamarind based soup/dip even without the accompaniments the dosa serves as a fantastic vehicle for eating your main selections and proves to be an interesting alternative to naanthe chicken tikka masala ($1495) and mushroom matar ($1295) are fantastic but i think the chefs abilities stand out most in the lamb rogan josh ($1595) the tomato broth is reminiscent of an authentic slow-cooked italian marinara that has been spiked with exotic spices and the flavors continuously evolve in your mouth revealing the sauces complexity the lamb is perfectly tender to boot and hasnt a hint of the gaminess that can come with lower quality cutsso is india palace the best indian restaurant in town? i cant affirmatively say yes (i had a spinach soup that was inedible and they dont use many fresh veggies in their lunch buffet) but it is definitely a contender india palace is an excellent alternative to nearby buffets on the strip and (generally speaking) far less expensive!  for about $12 you get a solid variety of popular indian dishes (chicken tikka tandoori veggie korma dosas basmati naan salad and desserts to name a few) which all taste pretty good  i have had indian food all over the world so thats a definite compliment from mealthough the place was pretty clean and had decent decor the service leaves some room for improvement  the location is also a bit seedy but understandable as it is on the outskirts of the strip  i also gagged when i discovered something that resembled a cockroach leg in my masala  after inspection id like to give india palace the benefit of the doubt even though ive never seen such a thing in the countless masala dishes ive had; but nevertheless it totally ruined my appetite but not enough to not give india palace a second chance  the lack of service and room for improvement on the curries (i have had better- saagar in newport beach is a comparable place and is much better) led me to give 4 out of 5 stars i stopped today to try the lunch buffet  what a great idea it was and thanks to my fellow yelpers for their reviews that helped me make my decisionthe restaurant was almost empty when i arrived at 12:30  service was excellent and i know it would have been even if there were a lot of people therewhile i was looking the buffet over the waiter brought me an iced tea as requested  shortly after returning to the table another server brought me a basket of fresh naanheres what i tried:vegetable pakora - good but not a lot of spicegoat curry - nice spice and very tastysaag paneer with cheese - flavorful with a nice zingbasmati rice - standardnaan - plain and goodchana masala - excellent with a nice spicinessbhindi masala - this was noted as a house favorite  i didnt think there was anything special about the okra nor the potatoes and it lacked much flavornavratan lorna - goodkarahi lamb - nice flavor and good spicechicken tikka masala - excellentras malai - excellent sweet to end this feastlest you worry that i cleaned the place out let me assure you i didnt  i took small portions of all these things just to try them  since i was alone i had a great time watching the bollywood bang-bang music videos on their tv screens  im anxious to come back for a relaxed dinner with friends and enjoy being served and trying some things on the evening menu that dont show on the buffet very nice indian restaurant the food is fairly priced and amazing in quality  best lamb chops and chicken tikka masala by far in vegas!!!  :) i love india palace its located in a not so prime location but once you enter the restaurant you forget what the exterior is like  the atmosphere has an elegant feel to it but doesnt require a person dining to be dressed up  the servers are all friendly and are very good at checking up on their patrons  their food is delicious!  i have tried their chicken tikka masala chicken saag lamb saagwala goat curry lamb briyani samosas and their naan bread (garlic is my favorite) and they were all so awesomely delish!  dont forget to order a side a mango lassi cause theirs is definitely one the best in the valley! with a coupon from restaurantcom $25 off $50 makes dinner here affordable for us every few months  for four people we order the mixed curry dinner ($26) and vegetarian dinner ($20) plus an appetizer if were still hungry  the chicken tikka masala is my favorite by far and the mango pudding is a great dessert  i love the mint chutney but sometimes its a little too salty  the service is always pleasant but often too attentive with five different waiters checking on us  i didnt know they offer a lunch buffet so i plan on checking it out soon! four people table service; two who really know and love indian food and two who love *this* place (though i am unsure of the breadth of knowledge on the cuisine itself) service:the service was fantastic vick really took care of us and having waited on my friends for the past four years exuded a certain cameraderie that really brought everyone together he made recommendations made sure we wanted for nothing and kept the meal moving forward without making us feel rushed in any wayfood:the food was mostly good not great but good tasty enough to share amongst friends over a couple bottles of wine and some good conversationthe paneer pakora (cheese squares made of 2 layers of cheese with some thin herb/veggie spread in between then battered and fried) was disappointing maybe the squares are too big and cool off too fast; it quickly becomes a hunk of room-temperature fried cheese it didnt make think of indian food as much as any other fried cheese product around townthe chicken pakora was much like the cheese; it seemed like any other fried chicken strip the flavors want to be there but its just not executed well enough not impressedthe samosas were really tasty the crusts were flaky and the stuffing was generous and flavorful layered flavors a great kick of spice and the textures were good a highlight for surethe sauces (mint tamarind and chili) were fantastic! really really flavorful and fresh we refilled our sauce dishes at least twice best part of the mealthe chicken tikka masala was tasty not the best in town but tasty we ordered one medium and one hot the hot was truly hot pushing the line of too much (and therefore hiding some of the flavors) still the flavors were good and the chicken was tender the peas pulao (basmati rice with peas and cashews) was pretty damn good actually i tasted a bite with a little of everything and really loved the freshness the combination of flavors great complementthe breads were good (my companions had to try at least four kinds?) i tasted a few small bits here and there and found them good again not great but good worth tryingcost/value:the apps and bread are priced well especially for groups who want to get a few things and share the entrees however are overpriced for what we received: appetizer size at entree prices the tikka masala was tiny for what they charge and the rice was a la carte (also a bit pricey for what you get) bad juju there as your entree becomes a $20+ dish but its just not a $20+ place it wasnt my dime but $200 for a group of four is a bit excessive for a place like this even considering the wineoverall: food (and value of same) made me think it was a 2-25 (edible but i have had much better) but the service and atmosphere was easily a 45! so a 3-star a-ok experience i *would* go again with my friends as they have a special affinity for this place but ill also take them somewhere else when its my turn to choose my first time here the restaurant itself is big and spacious but their parking lot sucks so make sure youre not driving a big car im good at back up parking my truck but it was really difficult turning around anywhere in this mini parking lotthe food was excellent i had the chicken tikka masala and my bf had the tandoori fish (all sizzling) we also got the peas pulau rice which is rice mixed with peas almonds and cashews (sounds weird you say? i know but man is it yummy) we also had 2 different appetizers that are like bread stuffed potato and the other is bread stuffed with minced lamb those smelled like yummy cheesy pizza when it came out lol the potato one was alright i dig the lamb one much more for dessert we got mango custard and wow it was good! pricing is somewhat expensive all the main dishes are about $14 and up my small bowl of chicken masala was $15 (eeep!)  we did order a sandwich (that almost like a greek gyro) for the bfs brother in the kids menu section and for only $3 it was a footlong so its give and take some dishes are expensive and some arentbut i would definitely come back here =) **summary**       - flavor - probably one of my favorite india restaurants in town the lamb is tender and not overcooked like other places       - price/portions - the prices are on par with other indian restaurants but the portions are definitely a lot smaller       - locale - the restaurant is located in a pretty bad neighborhood and the parking lot is dimly lit       - decor - though it might not look it from the outside the inside is quite nice       - lunch buffet - they have a lunch buffet for $1195 which i think is a way better deal moreover i wouldnt want to be in that neighborhood at night anyway**ordered**       - $1495 chicken tikka masala - creamy and delicious this curry is a must try       - $1595 lamb rogan josh - the lamb was tender the curry was a tomato base and wasnt as thick as other curries       - $295 garlic naan - your standard garlic naan fluffy and soft       - $395 cheese naan - they added cheese to regular naan it kinda tasted like a cheese pizza but better**recommendations**       - id definitely recommend this place however if you dont mind which meal id say go to the lunch buffet for a wider selection and a way better deal wellon a whim my friends and i were looking for a good place to eat and someone suggested india palace having heard the good reviews over the years we decided to give it a try i checked the yelp app on my phone and saw that with check-in on the app you get 1 free appetizer or cocktail with purchase the reviews were also favorable so in we went we arrived at 5pm and the place was seemingly in between shifts so we were sat promptly i noticed on signage that there were happy hour specials until 6pm so i asked the hostess about them she replied happy hour? why not?  you can get buy 1 get one free on appetizers  great it was about the same as the deal on the app so we ordered we had veggie and lamb samosas very nice as well as a few other items including garlic naan bread chicken briyani (chicken mixed with basmati rice with spices cashews & vegetables) and chicken tikka masala (tandoori white chicken marinated in yogurt & spices simmered in a creamy tomato sauce) pretty standard stuff we even opted for some traditional desserts and indian beerall in all the food was really good and tasty and i was very satisfied and full service was a bit off but i think that may have been due to the language barrier and sometimes the server would suggest an item and then bring something else in this case he offered a couple of different beers and then brought something altogether different it wasnt a huge deal as the beers were good and 3 of us were sharing so they went fastwhat was strange was when the bill arrived i asked again about the happy hour specials as the bill had not been adjusted our server was no where to be found and the server presenting the check had no idea what i was talking about i got up to ask the hostess that seated us about the specials (she was the one that said why not) and she acted as though she didnt know what i was talking about then reluctantly adjusted the bill the new server brought over the adjusted bill and seemed pretty aggravated at me possibly for asking about the discount? i dont know but it was not a happy presentation of the new check we paid and left i would go again possibly for a buffet situation as i wasnt completely satisfied with the service but the food was very good i think at least one of my friends wouldnt return due to the service we werent asking much but the hasty and unhappy presentation of out adjusted bill kind of put us off a bit like i said though we liked the food so who knows :)you should know that india palace is on a very sketchy part of twain ave it is literally always surrounded by police cars and as we pulled into the parking lot of the restaurant no less than 4 police cars with sirens blaring were pulling 3 guys out of a car next door and had them pinned to the ground at gunpoint i mention it because i know the neighborhood well and this has to be one of the less savory sections i just wouldnt want a tourist to stop in and be surprised but commotions such as an arrest at gunpoint in a connecting parking lothappy eating! my girlfriend and i ate here tonight  we had a restaurantscom coupon and needed to spend $50 to get $25 off    we started out with a bread basket with cheese garlic and lamb naans and onion kulcha  the lamb naan was particularly tasty but all four were fresh hot and flavorful      we then had the vegetable pakora which was like deep fried vegetable fritters  they were nice and crispy     my girlfriend having indian food for the first time went with the safe choice of the chicken tikka  just about right spice-wise for her and she enjoyed the dish  i however had the lamb pasanda  i ordered it with a spice level of 7 out of 10  it came out perfect for my spicy taste  it had a nice bite without overpowering the exotic flavorful blend of spices in the sauce   all in all we loved the food  the service was a bit slow even though there was only one other table of people when we got there  the waiter also tried to change my mind when i made my entree selection which was a bit annoying  apparently he thought a different dish would have been better suited to me  the decorum was very nice until you got to the tv hanging on the wall  it kind of ruined the mood set by the lighting and the paintings  price wise we got a lot of food for $50 enough to feed 4 people but we will enjoy the leftovers  id definitely go back india palace is the most authentic indian food in las vegas probably one of the best in us excellent food quality very good service friendly staff esp gary and many they remember us each time we visit their catering is very well priced and he sends lots of food not to mention very tasty their best creations are chicken tikka masala malai kofta paneer tikka and paneer tikka masala downsides food is on the pricier side buffet could be more variety its usually same stuff i prefer their ala carte this experience has virgin all over it  the first time for real indian food the first time at india palace  i can say that the it was extremely pleasant the food was very good i ordered the chicken tikka masala (medium spice) there was no hint of hot but the chicken was smokey and the sauce was delicious  my husband ordered the lamb rogan josh (medium spice) again not hot but delicious we ordered the aloo tikki a side of peas pulao and garlic naan  we left no crumbs behind  i will add the hotest food i had that night was one of the three suaces that came with the flat breadthe atmosphere was just right for my husband and i out for date night  they had recently (within the last two years) renovated the place and it was nice the neighborhood is in an older part of town but close enough to the stripalthough i have nothing to compare this too i felt the need to express our satisfaction and desire to try the cuisine again and again the food is fantastic  the staff is attentive and polite  we had the vegetable samosa and onion kulcha to start  followed by chicken tikka masala (really good) and a mushroom dish that i cant remember the name of but we thought it couldve been a little more spicey hot for our taste but was still good  we also had rice with peas and nuts with various spices  the dips they serve when you sit down are tasty  one spicy hot pepper one sweet and the other a mint  overall everything was very tasty and they didnt seem to use too much salt like most restaurants do  its a bit far from where we live but will be worth the trip back the best indian food in las vegas!  we finally got a chance to try india palace and it did not disappoint!  for appetizers we had the veggie samosas and the onion kulcha  the samosas were fantastic the onion kulcha very good but i would probably try something else next time we had chicken tikka masala and matar mushroom for entrees both were scrumptious     the food was on the spicy side in general which we love  funniest part of the evening was after wed been munching on the papadums with various sauces one of the sauces was extremely spicy and we told the waitress/hostess wed like to have our entrees just as spicy  she looked at us and said youre white right??  i almost fell off my chair!  apparently most caucasians dont request their food spicy all the better for us        everything was reasonably priced and evocative of the fantastic indian restaurant wed left behind when we moved here from new jersey  this is the best indian in vegas hands down if it werent for a groupon offer i would have kept on driving by this restaurant its not in the greatest neighborhood so i never would have gave it a second thoughthowever i am glad we took a chance and we highly enjoyed our meal tonight we ordered chicken korma chicken tikka masala 2 orders of garlic naan and 1 plain naanboth curries we flavored just right we ordered medium but couldve have handled a bit more kick in both curries naans were yummy as well - soft and fluffy garlic naan just had the right amount of garlic the place was quite busy tonight however service was not lacking nicely decorated interior as wellid recommend this place if you were in the area and are in the mood for indian i ordered food from them on-line and was shocked to find that the chicken tikka masala did not include rice and was $1495!!!! absolutely outrageous india palace is my favorite indian restaurant in vegas  my favorite dishes are the chicken tikka masala and the chicken makhani  the cheese naan and garlic naan are also excellent  the servers are friendly and helpful with recommending dishes especially our favorite server garry  we use certificates from restuarantcom every time we go to save money we had ordered chicken tikka masala dal makhani and naan there it was simply yum!!! daal was tooo good!!! the lady of the place was really nice to us its definitely a to-go place for us on our next trip to las vegas we were in town for an event and had the chicken tikka masala the samosas the orange drink with yogurt the garlic naan and the fried fish  loved it all mostly like that it was romantically lit and the service was ok  i love trying different things i have been going to india palace for the last 12 years the team at india palace even catered our wedding the food is outstanding and i have eaten at a lot of places in town the chicken tikka masala is the house dish that is the best they have put a lot of money into the restaurant and it is way better than what it was a few years ago if you have not had indian food before then go during lunch and try and buffet you can get a little bit of everything the chicken tikka masala and well everything else here tastes amazing! however i am severely allergic to cashews and i told our server this he said they could make the masala for me without cashewsbut they forgot or something so i had a pretty bad allergic reaction at the table that left me sick for two days i havent been back since because im scared but if you like curry and arent allergic to cashews you should definitely check this place out the first two bites of that tikka masala were (almost) to die for! this is a fairly small restaurant but the decor is nice and the service is friendlytheir chicken tikka massala is very good with a great tandoori flavor on the chunks of chicken  they have a lot of traditional items on the menu as well not just westernized disheswhen i get a craving for indian this is the place i go this is my first foray into indian cooking here in las vegas so i have to say im very impressed with the scope of the menu as with the freshness and flavors of the dishesservice was alright not particularly friendly but efficient none the less though there was an older woman bringing out the dishes she was amazing! i think she may have been one of the owners just amazingly warm and friendly wish she was our server the whole timethe tvs and sound system were playing bollywood music videos which was pretty fun! they do have a full bar! oh and be sure to check in we got a free mango lassi on to the disheschicken tikka - moist fragrant flavorful and oh so tender!chicken tikka masala - big bold flavors creamy and again insanely tendermalai kofta - similar to the chicken masala though not as spicy balls of cheese and vegetable sitting in a thick creamy gravy garlic naan - lightly crisp with a nice chew this complimented our dishes with the ability to scoop up the amazing sauces basmati rice - another amazing vehicle for the more gravy laden dishes well be back! i had been craving indian food for a while now so i forced my man to come with me unfortunately he is not a huge fan of indian cuisinewe got here at 8:30 on a sunday night and there was just 1 other table besides us this place is located in a pretty sketchy neighborhood but once inside its not that bad we ordered: -the tandoori chicken dinner special: tandoori chicken saag paneer mixed vegetables ($2595)-the mixed curry dinner special: chicken tikka masala chicken sagwala chicken masala ($2595) -dinner specials also come with dal soup (traditional veggie soup with delicately spiced lentils) and choice of bread we got garlic naan & roti -they also give you complimentary pappadum & chutneys -mango lassi (free with check-in but they only let us have 1 to share lol)  tasted like a sour mango yogurt milkshake lolthe food was just ok my favorite item was the chicken tikka masala~ the service absolutely sucked even though there were 7 servers just sitting around no one even came to refill our water glasses or check up on us even once anyways after we left i started feeling sick and when we arrived home i most definitely was sick ewww i got food poisoning from there and spent the next day feeling absolutely miserable the total bill was over $50 and the food quality was the same if not worse than a standard lunch buffet thank the lord i had a restaurantcom certificate so we only paid a little over $37 but it was not worth getting sick for i will stick to mount everest or try mint next time blehhhhhhhh~hot tip: indian lunch buffets are absolutely the way to go~!!! i came in for the lunch buffet and i was surprised they had more options than my usual indian rotation (mint and mt everest) however this place was quantity more than quality the goat curry was really salty like really it masked the flavor of whatever spices they put the vegetable mikhana (veggie tikka masala) was off way off to a point it was sourish however the chicken mikhana (chicken tikka masala) was actually tasty i guess they cook it differently the chicken was so tender it was shredding apart i enjoyed their palak paneer as well but the paneer was too tough for my taste; it couldnt pick up the flavor of the spinach and spices overall i would not be able to fit this place into my rotation however service was great! my water was never empty and i was downing that water like crazy because of the goat curry i went in on a tuesday and they charged me 1195 which is not right according to the information on this listing or maybe they overcharged me weve been looking for a good indian restaurant in vegas since we moved from nyc and read about india palace so decided to check it out for dinner  it was pretty quiet on a sunday night  there were only a few other patrons which is a shame because our experience at india palace was great  as other yelpers mention they are located near the strip but on the border of a crappy neighborhood  i wonder if they were in a better location if they would have more diners but i digressthey served papadum and 3 different dipping sauces when we sat down which was very nicewe started with the kheema samosas for an appetizer  the shell was nice and crispy and not greasy at all  they were filled with delicious ground lamb and green peas  i thought it was wonderful with the date sauce (the dark brown one) on itwe ordered the chicken korma and chicken tikka masala for entrees  both were very good  the chicken was very tender  the entrees didnt come with rice as has been our experience at most indian restaurants so we had ordered a side of peas pulao rice and garlic naan  i loved the rice with peas and nuts in it  the garlic naan was also very good and not greasy at allservice was attentive and all the staff very friendly  the restaurant was neat and clean  there were tvs playing bollywood which was fun  they werent on too loud and i always find it hard to not watch!  our waiter provided us with containers to pack our leftovers  if we werent so full i would have liked to try their dessert menuour dinner came out to about $60 including tax and tip  indian food is always a little pricey so i thought it was good value for what we gotwe enjoyed our experience here and will definitely be back to try other menu items the dosas in particularthey honored the free mango lassi for checking in which was delicious with my meal thanks yelp! ive been here before and had tried to find it again to no avail a friend and i happened to both want indian at the same time but having no idea where to go turned to my trusty yelp app and it found this awesome place for me again! its tucked off in a little shopping area but well lit and easy to find its got a great cozy interior with roomy booths and indian movies playing constantly it has a full bar also!checked in using my yelp app and received a free drink called a mango lassi i would never have known to ask for this had i not gotten this check-in offer but im so glad i did it was seriously delicious its mango and yogurt and it was part of the reason i couldnt eat all of my food highly recommend you get this fabulous drink!for an appetizer we had vegetable samosas they were dense and a little dry but with the spicy cilantro sauce to put on it it tasted just fine you get two and theyre a nice size for dinner my friend had chicken tikka masala which while not outside the box is definitely a solid choice he liked it and proceeded to eat all of it i had the mata paneer and it was just the right spicy (medium) with a rich tomato-y taste mixed with peas and the paneer cheese had it over a bed of jasmine rice and it was super filling one of my favorite dishesalso ordered a side of garlic naan which was okay it wasnt the best ive ever had way too much garlic but it was find and went okay with the meal the service here can be spotty i wasnt impressed with that at all but its not the worst ive had soanyway great food nice atmosphere and at a reasonable price definitely recommend awesome food great atmosphere food was a bit expensive but totally worth it went on a thursday evening and it was still crowded usually a really good sign considering that the restaurant is in a weird part of las vegas (looked shady) the inside of the restaurant was really well decorated and we felt comfortable once we settled in checked in on yelp and got a free mango lassi wowreally tastyhad the samosas and aloo tikki both good had the non veg curry thali and all the components was fantastic except the mango custard next time i will try something else it came with lamb in spinach chicken tikka masala and shrimp curry excellent we will be back soon it was not love at first sight for my friend indian food and myself in fact we hated one another pretty good in the beginning all of that changed after my first experience at india palace to be honest ive only eaten at two indian restaurants in my life after eating here im not sure i will venture elsewhere so on a lonely afternoon my wife and i decided to ditch our co-workers and meet for lunch fortunately india palace had a yelp dealio going down where you get $30 of grub for $20 a stellar deal no restrictions were mentioned upon purchase however when i presented the coupon the server said it was only valid for dinner after explaining there were no restrictions mentioned in the disclaimer or at the time of purchase he graciously accepted the coupon and we enjoyed their lunch buffet with two refreshing pepsi-cola beverages im a huge fan of their tandoori chicken but the meal wouldnt be complete without their piping hot freshly baked nan i could honestly make a meal just out of that my favorite item at the buffet is the chicken tikka masala which is tandoori chicken marinated in yogurt & spices in a creamy tomato sauce its 8:45am and my mouth is watering just thinking about it i even enjoyed a serving of their creamy spinach popeye would be proudthe service at india palace is always exceptional the servers are friendly and attentive your drink never stays empty for long plates are whooshed away at lightening speed upon completion and i always leave here feeling good about my experience and reminded as to why ive never gone to any other indian restaurant 5 glowing stars! india palace never disappoints! chicken tikka masala is amazing and the bhindi masala is delicious! we always get garlic naan with our meal and make sure to order extra to take home my husband and i try to come here as often as we can! my wife was craving indian food so we went to her favorite indian restaurant  i ordered a taj mahal beer & free mango lassi with the yelp check in  we ordered the following food items: vegetable samosa garlic naan chicken tikka masala & mixed grilled tandoori  everything was excellent as usual  our server garry was very nice and helpful  i promised to let everyone know that he was the best i have been dining here for over 10 years i am an indian who is very passionate about my food  each time i visit india palace food and service always exceeds expectations  our top favorite items on the menu are chicken tikka masala paneer tikka bhindi masala and malai kofta  the staff is very polite and go out of their way to give you best possible service today our server was gary i forgot my gift card in the restaurant and he ran out to the parking lot in the cold weather looking for us and handed me my gift card which still had a balance of $40!!! thank you gary and thank you india palace for taking care of my indian food cravings for all these years! you are the best i was in the mood for indian while visiting las vegas and i liked that they offer a free mango lasi for checking in on yelpthe first time i visit an indian restaurant i stick with certain dishes i ordered the malai kofta chicken tikka masala samosas and garlic naan bread the naan bread was the best part of the meal it was well made and came out piping out the samosas were so oily that i barely touched then the malai kofta had a nice flavor but i did not enjoy the chicken tikka masala at all it tasted a little like feet my meal wasnt terrible but i didnt like that they charged for both the rice and the naan bread one is usually complimentary when you order an entree i probably would not return because there are plenty of indian restaurants to try in las vegas great place!!! chicken tikka masala is one of the best ive ever had!! great service and nice and clean!!highly recommended!! this place rocks! i have eaten at indian places all over the western us and ive never had better indian food than this place garry our waiter was incredibly nice and gave us fantastic service every single dish we have tried is better than any other place here in vegas so far we have tried the chicken korma chicken vindaloo malai kofta and the chicken tikka masala and they are all to die for the meat is cooked perfectly and the sauces are so good you will lap it up from your plate give these guys a try you wont regret it the chicken tikka masala was honestly the best ive ever had the sauce was smooth and perfectly spiced the cheese naan was very light and soft and perfectly paired the masalathe only complaint was that the masala didnt come with rice just ate at the india palace and wow! tandoori chicken was moist and delicious chicken tikka masala was maybe the best ive ever tasted and the curry was perfect top it off with great naan bread and unbelievable service from manny and the result is my first yelp review ever ive had indian food in various countries to include england and countries very close to india and this is in the top 2 ever we went there on a weekday night by 10 pm as the place closes by 1030 pm they refused to let us dine in but said that we can order take away we ordered 2 plain naans 2 garlic naans and chicken tikka masala we waited for 30 mins but we were not given any update on our order only when we started to pester them about our order they hurried into the kitchen to get it ready the taste of the food was good the parking lot was a bit cramped it would have been full if we had come by 9 pm service was the main negative of this place they were not hospitable to us too business oriented and in your face attitude i had the chicken tikka masala and it was delicious i would have to say this is probably the best masala i have tasted in a long time and i have been to many indian restraunts around the country  the bryani also was tasty! i will be back soon! the flavors were amazing in all the dishes i tried ac my husband and i went here for the first time  the papadums were tasty and came with three sauces: mint spicy and a brown one  i like the brown one not sure what flavor it is  the mint and spicy sauces were too spicy for me since im pregnant  our starters was papdi chaat which was crunchy with a great taste  for our main courses we shared the chicken tikka and shrimp jalfrezi with rice and roti  the rice is a huge portion which we didnt even eat half of  the chicken tikka was very tasty with the onions and peppers  the chicken tikka tasted even better with the brown sauce that comes with the papadums  the shrimp jalfrezi was great over rice and placed on the roti  the food is deliciousthe service was great  indians always know how to give good service india palace has been my go-to indian food spot for a while now i stick to lunch buffets as i dont really mess with dinner at most indian restaurants; its usually just the same served a la carte at higher prices palace along with majority of the all the indian restaurants in town is located in a somewhat shady area just north of unlv while the area might suck ip is probably the nicest building in the area which helps a bit going into a indian lunch buffet i know exactly what i want to eat: chicken tikka (the boneless chicken chunks in the creamy orange sauce) saag (spinch dip with extra butter) samosas rice and naan based of this india palace delivers a great lunch buffet the food is refreshed regularly (frequency depends on how busy it is) and the quality has been consistent my one gripe is that they never give you enough naan and make you wait when you request morethe restaurant as i mentioned is pretty nice recently renovated and is great for large groups or more intimate meetings but the parking is terrible service is average theyve messed up my check several times and i have had to call them out on it every time remember the yelp check in for a free mango lassie (only 1 per table wtf?) and the yelp deal! first off this review is for the so-called customer service here so let me begin my friend and i had been waiting all week to finally come to this spot to try indian for the first time  i had read all the great reviews about the chicken tikka masala and how good the garlic naan was so we were pretty excited about itas we entered we werent really greeted politely we were kind of looked at like we were lost  i asked the waiter if we could have a table for 2 so he pointed and said booth 3 so we walked to the nearest empty booth he was possibly referring to  we sat for about a couple minutes till the same waiter came over and said youre here for the buffet right? we looked at each other confused because it was our first time there so i asked him if we were able to order from the menu he looked annoyed and went over and grabbed a couple menus and brought them overmy friend and i were already set on ordering ourselves the chicken tikka masala because of the great reviews and the garlic naan as well we waited a few more minutes then a different waiter approached us and asked us if we were here for the buffet  i politely said no we are first timers and not too sure what was being served at the buffet  he then described all the choices i asked if the chicken tikka masala was available and he had said no i also had asked if the garlic naan would be available at the buffet and he said no they would have to make it in the back and bring it out  he was really trying to push us to eat at the buffet but we were really set on trying the dish we wanted  so he took our order of 2 chicken tikka masalas and the garlic naani then asked about the free mango lassi you receive if you check in on yelp  my friend and i both showed our check-ins then he says that only one person per table with a coupon gets a free mango lassi (which was not stated on the coupon or app that it only applies for 1 person so if youre going with a friend or friends be prepared that only one of you will get a free mango lassi if you check in here)during the time while waiting for our order no one approaches us and lets us know our food will be ready soon or to re-fill our water cups or to check in on us at all  finally our food comes out and its a pretty small bowl of the chicken tikka masala a few small pieces of boneless chicken submerged in like 5 ounces of their sauce and spices but it smells delicious then a basket of the naan which really wasnt much since we both shared two pieces each and a bowl of rice to share between the both of us (i thought per order of a dish you get your own rice but i thought wrong)food definitely 5 stars  being a first timer i was satisfied but for the price of 2 bowls of chicken tikka masala sharing a bowl of rice and an order of garlic naan (which came out to be a little over $20 each) im disappointed  not too sure if he had charged us the dinner price and gave us a lunch size meal all in all my friend and i both enjoyed the flavors of indian food for the first time but will probably never come back here again 35 stars overall i go to a lot of indian restaurants mostly in la this is my first in vegas food was okayfood:mixed veggie pakora (4 stars): not too oily so you dont feel too guilty naan (4 stars): fluffy and yummy this was actually really good here!chicken tikka (4 stars): juicy and moist chicken really good id recommend this mixed vegetables (1 star): burnt vegetables no flavor! i cant even believe they would serve this the veggies were half black from being burnt requested a scrambled egg curry (35 stars): was more of just dry scrambled eggs didnt have a curry sauce we asked for a curry sauce on the side and it made it taste better service (4 stars):the guy helping us was really nice listened to what we wanted and kept saying he understood our special requests but when the curry and sauces we requested came out they werent what we wanted so i think he just thought he knew what we wanted he did try though which was nice atmosphere (4 stars):nice place on the inside clean and spacious they have long tables in the middle for big groups and booths on the side i love this india restaurant probably the best one in las vegas the prices are very reasonable & the service is awesome i like how they always have indian music/ videos playing for their customers & also to show everyone whats the indian culture is about i think they also do have a buffet for lunch for $11 all u can eat i have yet to try that but everytime i go there i get the chicken biryani my all time fav indian fried rice i also do recommend  for all the new comers to try out the chicken tikka masala & the shish kebabs let me tell you if u dont like spicy food u may have a problem eating here but hey u can also try mild but where the fun in that overall i like the restaurant & the food is delicious a must try indian restaurant if u live or visiting vegas i took my cousin to try this place as she had never had indian before and was interested in trying it she loved it! we ordered the chicken tikka and a lamb vindaloo both were excellent but the chicken tikka was amazing i was pleasantly surprised to see my old friend vimil (vick) working here now he took great care of us i love the location of this place right next door to my favorite gay bar i need to go back to try the lunch buffet if you love indian food or have never tried it i highly recommend this place ask for vick and he will help you figure out what to order after watching the movie life of pi on blu-ray i was craving for indian food found this place thanks to groupon my friend and i decided to hit up this place after she was done drunk shopping at fashion show mall lolcame around 6 for dinner right after we sat down there was an influx of customers for dinner whew got the orders in and didnt have to wait long ordered the following:appetizer combo - samosa aloo tikki veggie chicken and paneer pakora this was the first plate that came out duh its an appetizer its pretty decent and sharing it with two people is good enoughi enjoyed the samosa and the paneer pakora the most chicken tikka masala and fish tikka masala with plain basmati rice ok so the entree is where my heart somewhat melts got them both at medium spicy it was too much gravy-yyy and not enough meat meat - gravy ratio: 1:3 bottom line i would hit up this place again but would try the lunch buffet because the groupon wasnt allowed to use for lunch buffet we went for normal entree menus and glad we did!items selected:- masala dosa: thin crispy rice crepes filled with deliciously spiced potatoes & onions- chicken tikka masala: tandoori white chicken marinated in yogurt & spices simmered in a creamy tomato sauce- mango lassi: check-in bonus!for dosa my all time favorite has been http://wwwdosasfcom in sf but india palace does it in a different way more crispy and lighter which was really good!chicken tikka masala was also very good and the naan was tasty for basic items execution is everything and they did quite well fresh and hot no stale leftovers we usually see in lunch buffet were observedill return for the dosa we purchased a living social deal $15 for $30 credit on a recent trip to vegas-- i gotta say i would definitely go back even without the deal pros: the food reasonably priced these were more than enough for two people (we had leftovers & ordered extra naan for later)lamb rogan josh $1595 plain basmati rice $395chicken tikka masala $1495garlic naan $295their free mango drink when you check in is soooo goood cons: nothing really just the service was a little slow they had a private party going on in another room but our server garry was great!basically worth checking out bomb indian food entertaining music videos on tv friendly staff i was never a fan of indian food until i found indian palace now at their 3rd location in less than 10 years and despite that the location keeps changing the food stays consistent (which is a rarity)  their lunch buffet is one of the most diverse ive ever seen from an indian restaurant with 2 rice dishes (bryani and basmati) several vegetable dish choices and several meat choices  small tossed salad and dessert as well at chai round out the offeringsmy favorites are the chicken tikka masala bryani and spinach but i eat almost everything there  it is the best indian food ive hadever firstly this is the best buffet ive found in arizona i havent done too much looking on the scottsdale side admittedly (since its a little too far from surprise) or in fact anywhere else except for the west side but i have been to maharaja palace and sutra and you just get more variety here as for the quality of the food its fairly middle of the road i didnt hate anything but i didnt particularly drool over anything either im impressed that they have lamb curry in the buffet though - being an aussie ive grown up with lamb as a staple meat and love it (its way too rare to find in the us though) but when i say the best im only ranking it in a comparative sense read oni got a-la-carte take-out from india palace for the first time last night ive done this several times from tandoori times ii and the smell has always assaulted my nostrils with deliciousness for the entire thirty min drive back home - enough to strongly consider pulling over and wolfing down a few mouthfuls before continuing the drive with india palace the travel smell wasnt as overpowering not exactly a good thing since that pretty much means they dont use as many or as strong spices i like strong spicy food on the other hand my car didnt retain the smell the next daynext i compared apples to apples taste-wise i ordered their chicken tikka masala and the lamb vindaloo - my standard choices ttiis dishes were simply more flavorful i mean the wife and i both liked india palaces versions but it wasnt worth more than three stars also got the aloo gobhi - it was a-ight but ive ~made~ better and thats saying something the vindaloo wasnt actually spicy at all despite me asking for all dishes to be prepared medium spicy i didnt need a drink for the entire mealamount-of-food-wise you do appear to get a little more food for your money with this place - more solid meat in the containers than sauce whereas ttii rips you off with 50/50 sauce/meat ratio a 10oz container of food for over ten bucks (such as those from tandoori times ii) is beyond highway robbery especially when you can get enough good chinese food to almost give you a hernia carrying it out of the store for twenty bucks at chen and wokthe naan was plain old average and ips naan completely failed the microwave reheat test i nuked half a naan for about 20 seconds today the resulting cracker had all the juicy softness of a frozen dorito hell i wasnt expecting sponge cake but i ~definitely~ wasnt expecting a crunch that made my teeth hurt and my ears ringso ill probably go back and i may even get takeout from here again but i continue to lament the quality of indian food on the west side would some enterprising business person please open an indian restaurant somewhere west of the 101 (and north of the 10!) im so sick of nail salons pizza places and dentistries being the first second and third businesses respectively to open up in any new strip malls sigh consistently the best indian food experience i have found in the phoenix metro areawonderful chicken tikka masala splendid lamb  korma and delightfully spicy lamb vindaloo are not to be missedall in all a great experience reviews for this place are really misleading  we went there today and we were very disappointed  if youre looking for more authentic indian food  this is not the place  we noticed that the chicken tikka was sweeter than usual when we asked the chef if it had ketchup or bbq sauce he mentioned that they did use some ketchup  we ordered 3 other dishes biryani lamb chili and chicken karahi  the biryani was not fresh - the chicken was sub-par the lamb chili was ok - a little bland and the chicken karahi was relatively the better dish of the night  again there was only one other table that was occupied so maybe they werent prepared?we went there because we were at an event where they catered food from there and that catered food was much better than what we had at the restaurant   not going back there ewwwwwww so disappointed!!!  do not eat here! i truely think it is a heath hazard  my wife and i were excited to try india palace since we have not found a good indian restaurant in az yet  we read the great reviews on yelp and went in expecting to have a new favorite  we ordered the somosas as an appatizer and they came out cold almost frozen in the middle  we had to ask for new ones which came out steaming hot  problem sovled right?  wrong  next we had the chicken tikka masala chana masala rice and riata (yogurt dip)  i was the first to find a hair in my rice and then a minute later my wife pulled a 6-7 inch dark hair off of her fork too!!!  the chana masala was bland needed salt and the chicken tikka masala only had about 8 small pieces of chicken for $10!!  to top it all off i used the restroom to wash my hands and they had no soap in the dispenser only a dirty bottle of softsoap sitting on top of the dispenser  safe to say we will not go back  even with the $150 yogurt sauce being comped due to the cold somosas wouldnt you comp the problem item not the least expensive??  :( went here because we had bought a coupon off of livingsocalcom first the service was lacking there was only two other tables seated yet it took 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge us  the food was mediocre tasting the chickpeas were hard in the channa masala the chicken tikka masala tasted burned and the shrimp in the shrimp kadahi was overcooked  we ordered the food spicy and i found the food to be bland with just spice (heat) we did complain about the chicken tikka masala and they did switch it out for us  the worst of it all was that they didnt accept the livingsocial voucher the manager gave us some lame excuse and claimed that he had a sign up stating that it wasnt up that night for us to see frustrating!  i wont be going back my husband and i simply love this place we have been patrons here for over 10 years and although the food is pricey since everything is a la carte it is well worth every penny the restaurant also offers a lunch buffet which we have taken advantage of once or twice however we mainly love their dinners the wait staff is extremely friendly and attentive i highly recommend their chicken tikka masala the curry sauce is to die for i also love the chicken korma again fantastic flavor you can order the dishes mild medium or spicy they have recently really ramped up the spicy so it is very spicy indeed cant wait to eat here again soon 45 stars!so far (ive been living here two months now) this is the best indian food place ive tried makes me wonder why the reviews are so average for this place? the service is so-so but the food was great! had the tadoori chicken plate on a bed of onions and bell peppers lamb curry and garlic naan chicken was perfect moist on the inside and had a nice grilled flavor lamb curry was perfectly spiced with tender pieces of lamb and the potatoes were a nice touch naan came out hot crispy and garlicky great for dipping into the curry mango lassi was not watered down and was the real deal i actually had to ask for extra ice to dilute it because it was so thick yay more lassi for me!price is pretty standard for a indian restaurant but id want to come for the lunch buffet and try out some other dishes (chicken tikka masala biryani)cant wait to come back! impossible to take pics of this food since as soon as it hits our table we inhale everything best indian food ever great prices always has a groupon for 4 bucks off (buy for $4 get a groupon for $8 off order)  chicken tikka masala (now i can die knowing i have tasted heaven) we are from salt lake city ut and wanted to take our host out for indian food  he never tried it before and he really enjoyed it!we ordered samosas garlic naan chicken tikka masala chicken coconut korma and saag paneer the favorite at the table was the masala followed by the coconut korma the saag paneer had a bit too much spinach flavor and not enough of any other flavor  i love the saag paneer at bombay house in salt lake!  the rice we chose was the one with onions peas and cashews if i lived here and visited again which i would i would choose the plain basmati  the atmosphere was nice as well as the server  she was very helpful and gave suggestionswhat i really appreciated was that when we arrived an indian family was leaving and while we ate two other indian families arrived for dinner  if they like itits where i want to eat!overall a nice place with great food i would return if you visit utah try bombay house!,3.9571428571428573,70
Bollywood Grill Indian Cusine,this place gets three stars because of the decor and the owner is a character - nice guythe food is more like 2+ stars  portions are a bit on the small side and prices are a bit on the high side  we had chicken tikka masala and lamb vindaloo - both good not great  we also had malai kafta which was served in a gravy that is a bit stronger more heavily seasoned and more savory than the subtle almost sweet gravy we have grown accustomed to at other placeswith the cheezy decor the non-stop bollywood movies playing on a 50inch plasma and friendly staff we definitely left with a smile on our face  also they have a nice selection of indian sweets - halwa and stuff - in a display case by the cash register  we bought some to go and it was decent  i dont know anywhere else to get halwa on the west side all in all a very pleasant experience yet restrictive for the price  i really liked  the indian cinema theme throughout the restaurant and menu bollywood serves up smaller portions than most indian restaurants  but bigger doesnt always necessitate better when it comes to portion size our spread of cheese and chicken pakoras with mint sauce chicken tikka masala chicken biryanimattar paneer  with garlic onion and rogini naan  i must say that it did not disappointthe staff bent over backwards for us especially to help with our wine selection a chilean red  i will be back someday for their lunch buffet,3.5,2
India Masala Bar & Grill,i have the honor of writing the first review for this new restaurant !it has been open for just over a week now the decor is your typical new indian restaurant strip mall style dark woods and a nice clean appearance the table set up is certainly set up with the lunch buffet crowd in mind not a bad thing as there is plenty of space around each tableservice was fast and friendly with even the chef stopping by our table to check on usas of now they do not have a liquor license but they did say they expect to get it in the next couple of weeksthe important stuff the foodif you have read any of my indian restaurant reviews we tend to stick with what we know and like though today we did go with a chicken korma and butter chicken rather than chicken tikka masala and just for a change an order of the aloo palakwell honestly it was good very good in fact the sauces were some of the best i have had certainly better than origin and slightly better than mt everest the only negative would be the amount of chicken used lets say it was light in this area add some more meat to the dish and it would have been a home run the aloo palak was good i am not a big fan of this dish but the wife loves it and she raved about this versionthe naan (plain and garlic) were superb a little thinner than i normally like but boy a simple dish done perfectlyso all in all a good place to eat certainly the best indian on this side of town this is hands down the best indian restaurant in town went here for both lunch and dinner and was overwhelmingly satisfied each timelunch: theyre lunch buffet is huge! with $11 i was given a selection of 45 items 45 dishes (15 is usually standard in any indian buffet)  in an indian buffet is unheard of and it gets better what makes india masala stand out from its competitors  is that besides having nearly triple the quantity of dishes to choose from for less than $11 youre always in for a surprise unlike other traditional indian buffets the items on the buffet at india masala change everyday some traditional items such as chicken tikka masala tandoori chicken dal makkhani etc remain but for the most part dishes change each day also it features both north & south indian dishes in their buffet in the end best indian buffet in vegas dinner: when i step into any restaurant there are 3 things i stick my neck out for: food ambience & service the food is phenomenal my friends and i ordered a family dosa its a big big crepe about 4 feet long! also i had the chicken 65 as an appetizer lamb madras curry and garlic nan chicken 65 was highly recommend by our server it didnt disappoint it was a dry red chicken the flavor was quite different and thus hard to explain all i remember is that each bite felt electric literally lamb madras curry was also great i ordered a spice level 7 and it was perfect the curry had a great depth of flavor ambience is very beautiful as for the service this restaurant knows what it is doing theyre service is outstanding! im going to start off letting everyone know how i found out about this place these people are the same people as the india masala in the riviera hotel i have been going to that one since i found out about it and they told me about it this new one and i thought why not lets give it a try my friend and i decided to check out there buffet which is $1099 a fairly decent price for having choices ranging from north indian curries to south indian curries and even indo-chinese thrown in there as well also for a dosa lover like me they offer it in their buffet!!! i had tandoori chicken pakora chicken tikka masala (of course) goat curry fish curry curd rice avial (a south indian dishwhich was pretty good) tamarind rice rasam (a south indian spicy tamarind soup) raita and obviously naan/dosa (okay so all of it didnt fit in a plate i had to make a couple rounds and even though my friend kept making fun of me i felt satisfied for the $11 i had spent)!overall for an indian lunch buffet this place surpassed my expectations im usually very hesitant when it comes to going to indian lunch buffets because ive had a few bad experiences here in vegas but this my friends is a safe and sumptuous choice my friend and i have decided because we enjoyed this so much and because of its proximity to campus (unlv) we are going to come at least 2-3 times a week because we were assured that they will have varying items every daythe staff is very nice and helpful as well but like i said earlier we went to a buffet so we didnt have as much interaction as you would during dinner we are planning to have dinner there sometime soon because they have such a huge menu so ill keep you all  posted i have no idea who writes these reviews but this place has been waaaay overrated friends maybe?   i am indian and have been on a endless search for the best indian food (still searching)   i figure if a place can do a decent indian lunch buffet then they atleast serious about cooking authentic indian food during non-buffet times i went for the lunch buffet which i admit must be mildly seasoned to broaden customer appeal yet cant be too costly for the restaurant to make a profit but i expect flavorful seasoning and variety everything was underseasoned not enough salt or hot spicethere really was none the buffet had the appearance of being bountiful because of the meat and vegetables were in the front buffet it definitely captivate the eyes and stomach of customer  however once at the buffet i found it not logically flowing once at the buffet  it does not flow logically which would be flowing from appetizers and papadums to rice noodles and breads then veggies and meats  here the buffet started  with plates tandoori chicken chicken tikka fish curry daals vegetable curriesall very soupy items that probably should have rice or a starch served first so the sop up the gravies   in addition too much repetition 5 proteins- 1 fish curry and 4 types of chicken (tandoori wings tikka and curry)  4 daals and 2 batter fried vegetable and 2 cheap starchy filed vegetable dishesa gobi filled with chana and a vegetable curry dominated by potatoes and peas not reflective of the delicious quality vegetables dishes indian cuisine has been admired for  no paneer as a vegetarian source of complete protein instead of another chicken dish?furthermore a very disjointed buffet offering sambar without idli or dosa? mint chutney and tamarind chutney without samosa or chaat?  come on!  you give the facade of bounty but it is incomplete  you know better but undermine true indian buffet fans in order to cut costs there are a ton of indian buffets that are better for the same price and most are around youwhile this commonly happens at most buffets it seem to be with every gravy dish all the good stuff was gone and it seemed once it was finished it was finished yet coming at 1 pm and the buffet is from 11:30 to 3:00 pmi do expect it to be replenished but didnt see it happen in the 45 minutes i was there  understandably the dishes were mild but there should be some hot sauce/condiment offeredi didnt see any but i also never asked for any  out of all the dishes the tandoori chicken was the best it remained juicy yet it was still underseasoned and definitely not cooked in a tandoorione of the more promising things about the restaurant was that the atmosphere was nice and up to date and most importantly the service was way above par of most indian restaurantsas an indian it is rare to get treated as well as non-indian customers  here our water glasses were never less than half full and they appropriately checked on us from time to time without fussing or discriminating its about time i found a truly good indian restaurant in las vegas the chicken tikka masala was delicious when paired with their perfectly cooked garlic naan slightly crispy as well as soft and chewy tried the goat curry which was nice and earthy my date thought some parts of the meat were too tendony but i surmised that its because when cooking such an unusual meat they probably used most parts of the animal my only true complaint was that our waiter pretty much forgot to take our order and no one else came by our table in a long time there were only 3 other tables being served at the time! we didnt get to eat til about 40 minutes from the time we sat down im willing to forgive this hopefully one-time incident because of the surprisingly good food i was treated to a spectacle of the family-sized dosa being served at the next table it was huge! cant wait to come back and try it this place has excellent food! this is one of the top 3 meals we had while visiting vegas i ordered the chicken tikka with a side of lemon rice and garlic naan i cant emphasize how good this was and we will be back for more! this is by far the best indian food i have tasted the lemon rice was delicious highly recommend it the chicken tikka was juicy and favorable this place had some great reviews so i figured i would give the buffet a try i was really not impressed first impressions were good in the door it is nicely decorated and clean we got there about 7 minutes after the buffet had opened but the food looked like it had already been sitting out a while with skins on the tops we enjoyed the chicken tikka masala rice and the naan bread but everything else was pretty disappointing i was also surprised they had no desserts besides fruit most indian buffets i go to at least have rice pudding we ordered mango lassis as well because they didnt have cold chaiswhich didnt really taste like mango they were like white sour runny greek yogurt drinks honestly i will not go back there are much better places in town perhaps sit down is a better experience no idea how this place got any good reviews we went for the lunch buffet and it was awful we arrived right when the place opened and the food was not fresh already had a skin on it the buffet was laid out horribly the rice is in the back and not the front before the entrees there were no deserts besides fruit(wheres the kihr?) we tried almost every entree on the menu and the only one that was decent was the chicken tikka masala the rest was either bland or sour the goat curry had bones in it disgusting  also avoid the lassi at all costs it was sour and i could barely get through a few sips this either means the yogurt used had gone sour or they do not know how to make a lassi either way it sucked as you probably have already guessed i will not be returning even if they paid me do yourself a favor and drive two blocks down flamingo and go to mint instead! (get a strawberry or mango lassi it will show you how a lassi is supposed to taste) ive gone here twice so far and both times ive had exceptional service!  theres a deal from yelp you can use to get $10 or $20 off your meal  i love their masala chai naan their chicken tikka masala and chicken korma! they also have a great lunch selection as well definitely coming back to this place! clean and classy restaurantwelcoming staff and nice servicedid not really like the buffet may be they are showing less love in preparing lunch buffet itemseconomical food for the ambiance and  good for groupsits not the best biriyani you will get in vegas still i will recommend shalimar for best biriyanichicken tikka masala with nan is gooddosa is okits not the best indian food out there but can go once first timer might like it atmosphere was nice very clean service was atrocious seated quickly but waited forever just to order five tables with patronsfour wait staff just walking from one place to another doing nothing as dishes would empty we placed them aside in an organized manner yet none of the wait staff bothered to clear them we actually had a new dish brougt to our table and they simply moved aside the empty/used dishes and left them on our crowded table ordered the tandoori chicken and chicken tikka masala tandoori was not as flavorful as ive had at other restaurants tikka was good but it barely fed two people i expected more for the price in terms of quality of food and service a real disappointment will not be a repeat diner this place had one of the best indian food i have had!! the chicken tikka masala was amazinga good variety for their lunch buffetand usually u get a good discount coupon on yelp that helps free mango lassi with checkin!! that being said i had the lunch buffet the highlights for me were the chicken tikka masala tandoori chicken garlic nan and keer the potato pancake was interesting as well similar to what ive had in korean cuisine but this one has a bit of sourness to it there are different types of chutney and also salad some of the vegetarian dishes were tasty as well but im disappointed there was no paneer overall it is good service is excellent as the staff was very friendly and helpful i think we had 6 yelp checkins and they were so happy to give us our free mango lassi so much so they even gave us an extra one there is also pineapple n cantaloupe for those who like to end their meal with fresh fruit the saag was ok but lacking the strong layering of flavor that i expect in this dish also the chunks of garlic were all different sizes (some were about 2 inches!) the chopping is so sporadic and obviously rushed the chicken tikka masala was super greasy! waaaay too much ghee or maybe even oil the chicken in the tikka masala was grainy and powdery and there was so little of it oddwe ordered from eat24 where it said that theyre delivery fee was free then when we checked out our receipt said it was a $5 charge they said that india masala charges $5 for delivering far away we are literally 3 blocks from them and that is considered far? whats close? if you live in the same strip mall as the restaurant? our order took an hour and 15 minutes to arrive we will not be ordering from them again new disclaimer: i get extremely cranky when my blood sugar drops so i did go back to the lunch buffet based on the buffet alone i think i would like to go for dinner at some point i thought the food was exceptionally good not just for a buffet but in generali did the lunch buffet for takeout they are generous with the containers (and separately packaged naan) so i was able to try pretty much some of everything (and lots of some things!) the selection is small but the bases were fairly covered i knew going in that i wouldnt find samosas but i still missed them there also wasnt any pakora and a few other standard items i was surprised not to see still what they do have is solid the tandoori chicken was basic but well-prepared and moist the chicken tikka masala was exceptionally good as was the fish curry they had to the best of my knowledge (and please feel free to message me if im wrong) india masala is the only spot offering a takeout option for their buffet as you might know from my earlier review my time is extremely limited on weekday afternoons its good to know that i could pop in fill a few containers pay and be on my way in a few minutes with enough delicious food for both lunch and dinner we had a very tasty meal here tonight the mango lassi had full mango flavor! yummy! the chapati and sauces were the best i have had and yes i have eaten indian food before  many times although not in india but in london we ordered chicken tikka dosa goat curry basmati rice and naan it was our first time having a dosa not sure that we have seen this on a menu before but we are glad that we tried it! if you have never had one and you like crepes this is a must have! of course the sauces that went with it were just delightful bursting with flavor in every bite the curry was also very flavorful and so was the wonderful naan we order the rice so the goat curry had something to sit onfor two of us we had way too much food but managed to eat most of it service was very attentive and pleasant wonderful experience and great food,3.588235294117647,17
Omar Khayyam,omar khayyam is a great indian restaurant and although the prices are pretty steep the food and service is excellent  i came here with my parents last year and we all thought it was amazing with authentic indian dishes ranging from marinated sea bass to chicken tikka masala  i went for the shami kebab starter followed by the lamb tikka  they didnt take long at all to arrive and tasted great when they did  all the meat which they use is of the highest quality and the lamb was tender with no chunks of fat or sinew whatsoever  most mains cost at least £10 and side orders of rice or vegetables are about £3-4 each  its not a cheap meal but the food service and general ambiance all make the cost well worth it,4.0,1
Iman's Grill,ive been to the one in bruntsfield as well as on nicholson street and both have been excellent definitely a step up from other indian restaurants and the decor and atmosphere is inviting in addition to friendly staff ive had chicken tikka biryani a specialty punjabi dish (cant remember the name) as well as tasted others meals and everything has been great also its byob which cuts down on the price of the bill and is a fun time to get together with friends id recommend this place to anyone! although ive been told its not authentic ive never been to india so i dont know what is but it tastes good to me!,4.0,1
Mother India's Cafe,i was a bit leery of paying tapas plate prices for indian food but this was delicious and worth the small premium  we did pay a wee bit more than we wouldve for a more traditional indian menuthe aubergine (eggplant) fritters were amazing the samosas were some of the best weve had and the chicken tikka mahkni sauce was creamy rich and the perfect blend of spicy & sweet mother indias was my first experience of non-british indian food you know what i mean indian is indian but us brits have a way of doing it that makes it distinctly british-indian creamy kormas and dont forget the vindaloo dont get me wrong this sort of indian is nice but its all a little repetitivemother indias cafe serve up far more authentic indian food in tapas style portions which means you can order 2 or 3 different dishes to share in all the flavours and textures and this can only be a good thingthe curries are absolutely delicious and a million miles away from the standard chicken tikka masala my personal favourites are the aubergine and potato curry channa dahl ginger and chilli chicken lamb pasandain fact its all pretty damned goodthey also do a takeaway service (although no delivery) and its something i make use of frequently rather handily with the takeaway you can order a large portion which is bigger than the tapas portions you get with sitinive only done takeaway from here so far and everytime the food has been hot hot hot (both tasty hot spicy hot and sexy hot yep you heard me)my only recommendation? try it recently went to mother india with my gang of friends a friend of mine  thrown a party for his new job!there is always a reason to celebrate !! we were 5 people and i have something in mind to order as all other guys were no idea about what to eat it is a tapas style and not badspicy hot good ambience calm relaxed no problem to get the table the staffs are friendly we ordered nans kebabs butter chicken patina lamb chicken tikka makhanibutter chicken particular was so tastywowyes we were so hungry ! offcourse some pintsit was about 80pounds and not badi find some this cafe particularly authentic in thier indian stuffs btw its a tapas style so you can order other dishes tooall together it was a nice timeand yeswill visit again !!,5.0,3
Al Hamra,went there last night with a group everyone really liked the food and the service was excellent we shared 5 different dishes the lamb masala was particularly good as was the tandoor chicken tikka  this is the best indian food we have found in the valley (our group has been to many indian restaurants in england canada and elsewhere) the decor is a little plain but is clean and new fabulous food! i had the chicken tikka masala and my mom had the lamb korma  i went not so hungry but cleaned my whole plate! service was very friendly we took the take out menus home as this would be a perfect alternative to the usual rotisserie chicken or chinese take out! oh al hamra i love your chicken tikka masala and naan like no other the service is wonderful and the decor delightful and the wine list extensive but pleaseforbthe love of godplay some music  it is so quite in there that the other patrons discussions clear across the room seem loud and distracting  they need music to create ambience and privacy its almost akward al hamra is a nice indian food restaurant  that sounds like a pretty basic statement but thats kind of the point  my experience was not remotely bad nor was it remarkable  our waitress was attentive and friendly and i would give it four stars if it wasnt for the fact that one of the dishes we ordered was a lamb dish that was overcooked but i took them home for leftovers and it was oddly better  we got chicken tikka masala garlic naan and lamb chops  chicken tikka was exactly as i hoped and the garlic naan was perfect  it was flavorful and on par with what ive had at other establishments closer to home   i wouldnt order the lamb chops again but id order curry dishes without any hesitation and be confident that they are good  the lamb chops however as i said previously were overcooked  if you are in the area than i would recommend trying it out  its a great looking place with great staff but unfortunately is hidden in the mastros complex so deep that its more word of mouth than anything else  you certainly wouldnt drive by and know its there  it is however absolutely worth trying if you have a craving for indian food,4.0,4
Kabob n Kurry,this restaurant just recently opened  i checked out the place today for lunch  lunch is served buffet-style with over 8 different dishes to choose from  everything was really good & many of the dishes are at least a little spicy  my favorites were the basmati rice chicken fried rice hot chicken wings & chicken tikka masala  they serve up some naan to the table & that was very good too  everything was very rich & flavorful & you can tell they use high quality ingredients for all their dishes  i special ordered a non-dairy mango lassi & it was delicious!  vicky was the guy that ran the place there  he was great!  he didnt give me the feeling he was hovering but he was there to refill my water glass when needed & he also brought out some chicken kabob from the kitchen for me to try  that was also delicious!  he also knows how to create some ambiance - when there was a younger crowd that came in he changed up the music to something that they would like this is a great place for some top quality indian food  at $5 per person for a lunch buffet (drinks excluded but also extremely reasonable) you cant find anything else that comes close in price & quality  if youre in the area you should go check it out! this review is for dinner that i ordered to go -   i will go back for lunch (buffet style) soon and update my reviewthe owners are super nice and friendlychicken tikka masala was very tasty big chunks of premium meat spices were good only draw back was there werent many pieces of meat maybe 5-7naan  was slightly above average two large halvesdinner portions seem priced high since they dont come with rice or naan i spent $15 for these two items i was pleasantly surprised by their garlic naan and their chicken tikka masala the naan was soft and pillowy and the masala had chunks of good quality chicken this restaurant is really tasty before coming here we had gone over to copper kettle only to find the entire restaurant closed for a private party   i yelped the nearest indian and kabob n kurry had decent ratings and fairly close to where we were    we ordered the vegetable qourma chicken tikka masala garlic naan samosas and mango lassie    the vegetable qourma was a mixed back of frozen vegetables that was to put it mildy disgusting   chicken tikka was actually not bad - however more sauce that chicken   and the chicken pieces were small i felt like i had to fish into the bowl to find them   garlic naan was weak - too thick had the consistency of a focaccia bread   lassie was actually pretty good   samosa i think were frozen bought also - very thin and fried to so hard it was tough to even cut w/ a knife and forkstaff consisted of young girl and an older women who claimed she ran the place   young girl was very inexperienced never came back to refill our waters and forgot our samosas (there were two other tables w/ guests!)   manager was more involved in checking herself out in the glass window and texting on her phone; though she did ask us how we were doing it was not very genuineid recommend elsewhere for indian food a big group of friends and i went to kabob n kurry for my husbands birthday it was absolutely wonderful! the staff was friendly and the food was delicious there were about 10 people in the group and we were all really impressed and each one of us said we would come back we got the lunch buffet platters and it was great to be able to try so many different things the chicken tikka masala was probably the best ive ever had the kabob was different than ive had before (a ground meat and spice mixture rather than seasoned cuts if meat) and i really enjoyed it super flavorful! my other favorite dish was a side dish of potatoes we joked and called it indian style potatoes au gratin my cousin (who had recently returned from india)!said that kabob n kurry is the most authentic indian food hes had in the states well be back for sure!!! horrible food! we had the dinner buffet and there was barely anything left on the buffet counter the quality of food they served for $1199 is unbelievably bad extra salty dishes half-done naan weird tasting chicken tikka masala- very bad experience,3.3333333333333335,6
Curry Garden,sometimes its nice to get indian to go and watch a good movie at home to get the weekend started god i really dont sound like the childless 20-something that i ami ordered shahi paneer (easily the best paneer ive ever had taste and texture-wise) and it was so delicious my husband ordered chicken tikka masala and said it was the best he has ever had i also loved their rasmalai which again had the perfect texture and flavor weve been going to another indian restaurant for years (a 20-25 minute drive) but have recently been underwhelmed by the food i decided to try this place and im so glad that we did not only is it great its just around the corner from our house bonus! very fresh and tasty we were pleasantly surprised at the taste and quality of the food at this unassuming locale thoroughly enjoyed the samosa chaat spinach lamb and chicken tikka good sized portions good service the layout inside is different pretty small so may not be ideal for larger groupsbut lets be real i was trying it alone & liked having one of the 3 or 4 booths alone (dont worry i wasnt being a booth hog the place was empty aside from myself & one family) i had the chicken vindaloo medium spicy and got chicken tikka masala to-go for the boyfriend my vindaloo portion was huge enough for two but my boyfriends order seems a little skimpy my only complaint (as far as flavor) is neither order was spicy enough next time maybe ill ask for full-on spice and see how that goes eek! the family behind me ordered chicken skewers and the smell was ah-mazing!! i would definitely like to try that in the future just the smell had my mouth watering imagine the taste bud party after actually eating it closed mondays whaaat,4.0,3
India Masala,thank you sheila b for piquing my interest  eric r and i did a few hikes at valley of fire state park and headed back to vegas around 2 pm starving  he asked me if i had anything bookmarked on the north strip (look at him pretending to know everything about yelp!) and i said india masala at the riviera!!! haha we laughed - i had never been to the riviera ever!we parked and wandered through the maze and there it was in the food court  i ordered a masala dosa and eric got the tandoori combo  his came with naan cilantro chutney tandoori chicken on the bone chicken tikka chicken kabob some other chicken seasoned and daal (lentils)  mine came with coconut and tomato chutneys and spiced tomato soupthe meals were filling and tasty  i loved the chutneys especially the cilantro and it did its justice with my nose running!!  i would return for this hidden gem what a hidden gem as good as the food is india masala should consider a full restaurant we had the famous vegetable samosa to start with and the chicken tikka masala and masala dosa was very well seasoned and freshly made with a over sized piece of naan jasmine rice also comes with the tikka masala the food is delicious and they give you plenty of it the staff was friendly seating area is limited since its a food court the prices are a bit high for indian food in a food court but after eating here it was well worth it yum went here with misti y last night before the roller derby event and was really impressed their naan (included with entree) comes out big savory and soft with lots of air pockets and the chefs recommendation of medium-hot spice for my entree was pretty perfect i got the chicken tikka masala and look forward to trying the vegetable korma next time while waiting for my order i wandered down the food court to check out the other vendors and happened upon the india masala / gaylord india mini-truck parked outside - i had no idea that the rio hotels gaylord india restaurant was related to this food court satellite makes me want to try gaylord india as well and while we were waiting we ran into a cool elite yelper couple that misti had never met in person india masala is open late (past 1am) and curiously the late night menu is smaller but more expensive by $1-$2 i guess they kind of have a monopoly on masala after 10pm on the strip45 stars (if my dish were $8 or $9 instead of $12 i would give india masala 5 stars in a heartbeat) my current late-night fix has been 10pm happy hour sushi if we can figure out how to park close to the india masala mini-truck i think this could be a solid afterparty spot joining the likes of soyo herbs & rye satay slidin thru hq and bazic located in the corner of the food court at the riviera easy to miss but well worth the search the workers were very friendly helpful and patient excellent service i ordered the chicken vindaloo (requested extra spicy) and my friends ordered the chicken tikka masala both dishes come with rice and naan both come out to ~$13 after tax both plates give large portions relative to all other indian cuisines ive been to chicken vindaloo: kinda spicy i had hoped for spicier but oh well i loved it they use dark meat from the chicken and dont skimp out on your portion the potatoes couldve been better prepared it was a little hard or undercooked maybe the sauce was amazing and very well spiced rice was okay; no comments there the naan was great and fluffy and it was pretty heavily glistened with butter chicken tikka masala: i tasted some of my friends tikka masala and i thought it was also really good definitely one of the best plates ive had for indian cuisine it was reasonably spicy and spiced perfectly not many other comments since i only tasted it my 8 hour drive back in traffic was terrible not because of the traffic but because everytime i thought about the chicken vindaloo i had my mouth would salivate heavily hell even as i write this review im practically drooling next time im in vegas im definitely coming back here bomb!this place is so good! the family and i wanted to get a bite to eat before watching society of seven at the riveria hotel and casino so we made our merry way to the food court since theres a variety to choose fromwalking up to the food court you can instantly smell the wonderful spices used in indian food i love indian food so of course i didnt care to check out the other spots i wanted some curry and naan! i ordered the chicken tikka masal chicken vindaloo and naan omg so freaking good! both were served with white rice the naan was like the size of my face! it was coated in butter and i used it to soak up sauce from my dish the chicken vindaloo was my favorite it was nice and spicy and had a ton of flavor  i devoured the whole thing and ate some of the chicken tikka masal since that was my sisters dish she liked it too it could have been spicier but thats just personal preference it was kinda expensive but indian food is kind of expensive as is each entrée was $1099 and the naan was $199 the food took a while to come out but it was worth the wait i got a cup of water and the guy said if i wanted more water hed fill it up for me that was nice of him!i really like this place when i go back to vegas i will for sure come here for my indian fix im craving indian food for dinner now!best part: its open 24 hours!! as good as it gets!! the food might take a while to come out just expect it then it wont be as painfuli went here based on the reviews here i was suspicious first but i decided to give a shot since i was staying at riviera hotel anyway and was too tired to go far for food yesterdayit turned out the place was awesome i ordered my usual for indian food chicken tikka masara to go it came with rice and a huge naan plenty for one person  i was so full 2/3 of the container but i hated to see the rest go wasted so powered through to finish the whole thing (i didnt have a microwave to warm it up next day so saving leftover wasnt an option) it was that good  mango lassi was also delicious too perfect consistency and not too sweeti give 4 stars because i think the price is a bit steep for a food-court if you make it to go remember to grab silverwares and napkins they are a food-court joint after all so they dont put those gears in a bag for you you need to grab them yourself read the reviews before i went and thought it would be a great experience but should have paid closer attention to what they really said had the chicken tikka masala with a mango lassi the mango lassi was good the masala was over priced for the quality it was it is in a food court and should be evaluated as fast food not the greatest but okay when you are hungry and anything will do not the best if you are looking for good indian food though the naan was pretty good the question i had to ask was wheres the chicken?  too much sauce for the amount of meat so in the end the value to quality did not justify the price but if you get that late night craving for indian food in the city that never sleeps this would be an okay stop as they are open 24 hours but for a great meal of indian food find somewhere else oh my this place is so good i really love indian food i know the good stuff  servic was very good friendly chicken tikka masala very good not spicy thanks india masala my boyfriend and i checked in to the hotel around 2 am and we were hungry since its the only 24/7 fast food place in the hotel we got food from here we got the chicken tikka masala we got up to our room and the room and began eating and the chicken was cold the sauce was warm but the the chicken wasnt warm at all so my boyfriend called down to tell the restaurant our food was cold and the person that took our order said we took to long and hung up in his face i called back and ask if the manager was in he said no so i asked for his name and he gave me a fake name so the next day my boyfriend went down to talk to the manager and they gave him another meal free for fast food indian food it had a pretty good taste but some of their workers are unprofessional,4.111111111111111,9
Curry Leaf Indian Grill,yes we understand the owners are friendly i too like the owners they are a sweet couplenow regarding the actual place itself skip it its amateur food and i mean that sincerely and not as an insult the person preparing the food is not a chef or a professional cook by any means it just sees as if some random auntie and uncle decided to lease a space and start cooking fast food versions of indian food thinking: these dumb americans have no clue we will call it chicken tikha masala wrap and they will think its cool  im indian and i had a hunch this place was like that but i was bored and decided to pay them a visit and try this authentic food after all if the food is great then i could care less if its faux indian food  i ordered the chicken tikka masala bowl  i asked them if they could add some sauce to it and the owner responded: yes many customers have asked me to do that so we started to do that  first of all chicken tikka masala without sauce is like eating chicken soup without waterit doesnt exist  and what makes this story even more odd is that when i got the chicken with the supposed added sauceit was still dry  it had literally one teaspoon worth of sauce over some very dry and poorly cooked rice  and i paid 10 bucks for that  needless to say i didnt go backlook im not insulting your intelligence i know you have eaten indian food at an actual sit down indian restaurant and that this is supposed to be good in its own manner as a pseudo fast food version of indian hey fast food indianlove the conceptim down with thatunfortunately its already being done in bigger cities and its much better  even fast food indian has more flavor than this placefurthermore they are slow  you dont walk up pay 5 bucks and walk away with chicken tikka wraps 5 minutes later you walk up pay 15 bucks and wait 15-20 minutes for one auntie to microwave your food in the back,2.0,1
Haweli Indian Grill & Bar,i went to haweli indian earlier today and is a pretty new restaurant in the shea 14 harkins area (like one major plaza away more west on shea) the dining area is decorated very nicely and gives the feel of an upscale restaurant all the tables were adorned with really nice indian style table clothes on top of the standard nice white ones with water glasses and golden napkins beautiful chandeliers hung all over the restaurant area and there were tvs available for viewing sports we were greeted immediately and shown to a table of our choice while the waitress arrived and filled our water glasses the waitress was very knowledgeable of the cuisine and was able to describe it very well they have a large menu that is well detailed with descriptions of what each dish contained they brought out this cracker style bread and some dipping sauces before we ordered one sauce was tamarind based and was nice and sweet while the other was green and i think cilantro based and remind me of previous indian food ive had we ordered the garlic naan bread (a must) chicken tikka masala chicken madras and the tandoori chicken with rice all three of the chicken dishes were excellent the madras was the most spicy and went really well with the partha bread the tandoori was a nice lightly spiced grilled chicken with vegetables that is definitely the safest choice for the non adventurous members of the group then there was the chicken tikka masala it had such delicious spices with a nice sweet after taste it went excellently with the rice went excellent with the naan and was awesome by itself definitely the must have dish here so if youre only going to get one i suggest this but everything was delicious so there probably are no bad choices i will venture out a little next time i come but i think im going to make the tikka masala a staple with any party i come with overall they have really great service excellent food and a beautiful atmosphere this place should be on anyone who is in the areas; must try list go experience it yourself hopefully you have an experience similar to mine and if you do i know youll want to come back enjoy :) best indian restaurant i have been! i have been to easily over 300 indian restaurants in last 10 years place was spacious nice decor and our waiter was very welcoming we ordered goat korma and chicken tikka which was very delicious i have ordered medium it seemed little spicy for medium but loved the spice as i took more bites naan was good and service was really good too i will be coming back for sure!my wifer rating was 45/5 conservatively as she said,5.0,2
Swagat India,my husband begs to go here on a regular basis i havent been to the lunch buffet but everything on the menu ive tried has been really good the husband has only ever ordered the chicken tikka masala and refuses to try anything else ever i think hed pick it as his last meal we got take out from this restaurant and ordered the chicken tikka masala and shrimp korma that was recommended by sarah  we also ordered some bread recommended by the restaurant to go with this dishthey were friendly on the phone and pleasant at the time of pickup  the restaurant is extremely clean from what i can tell from my brief first impression   everything looked orderly and well organizedthey asked us what level of spice we wanted  i chose medium expecting the food to be mild in spice as so many restaurants tone down their spice for the american palate   i was happy to find the spice was indeed medium to my taste  so if too hot is too hot for you expect a true approach to heat level by this restaurantboth dishes were very good  the chicken sauce was the better in flavor to my taste  the rice came out of the box loose and cooked perfectly  nice jobwe cant give this 5 stars as we have not eaten in house but for take out they did a terrific job and we will be going back this restaurant has some of the best indian in town their samosas are obviously homemade and their chicken tikka is so good my husband loves the hot vindaloo with chicken we take out from here all the time! the first thing that struck us is how cocky this young waiter washe was probably thinking we at swagat are the bomb!! son i just moved here from the san francisco bay areai know and cook indian food and trust me you are not the bombfar from itfood was oknothing exceptional and definitely not what the reviewers here are going ga ga about but that is personal choicewe tried the chicken tikka and the vindaloo which was flavorful but definitely not worth the price we were paying quantities were not adequate for the amount we were payingis indian food really that expensive here in madison? the prices here are ridiculously overpriced for indian food and every single indian restaurant has the same price range for all dishes which would make me believe that they have some sort of indian restaurant owners union that decides on what the prices are going to be!!another thing that irks me is the inclusion of south indian food along with your rogan josh menu which raised a big flag for us regarding the quality of the food no serious indian restaurant owner would ever include a idli sambar dosa on a menu that has rogan josh or biryani on itperiod!just looking at the quantity of dishes on the menu and we knew this was going to be your below average indian faredefinitely not coming back hereunless of course the prices go downway down visiting the madison area from northern nevada where indian food choices are extremely limited this was by far the best most extensive indian buffet ive had in the states i lived in india for a year in the 80s and cant remember every single thing i loved to eat there but i do remember spending many afternoons in colaba in bombay eating masala dosas in a little upstairs restaurant im always tickled when i find dosas on the menu at an indian place as it doesnt happen oftenwe went out to dinner here and our table of 6 let me do the ordering and recommendations i was very impressed by the fact that when my husband ordered his meal hot they asked wisconsin hot or india hot? were fairly adventurous eaters so he said india and when he got it it was definitely spicy i wouldnt have wanted it much hotter myself i ordered the masala dosa and  i wish the dosa itself had been a little crispier but it was very goodwhile we were eating i saw a sign over the buffet that said pani puri! i was so excited - havent had that since 1988 on the streets of bombay so we went back for the buffet today but no pani puri that i could see after i tasted some of the other food it didnt really matter nearly everything i tried was great! i generally never order chicken tikka masala because we make it at home and i almost never find a version out that i like better when i eat indian food out id rather try the things i cant make myself :) my husband tried it and said he likes ours better so i didnt bother with it as there was plenty else to enjoy our waiter from dinner nearly a week ago saw us today and actually remembered that i liked masala dosas which i find impressive even more impressive is that they had them in the buffet too! wow!if we had a restaurant like this near us we would be spending a ridiculous amount of money here for those who like their indian food more spicy (hot) all you have to do is ask i personally feel this is a great representation of indian food as regards the price i didnt find it excessive at all i know how much money i spend at my attempts to make good indian food at home (with all fresh ingredients) and figure you can spend what $5-6 at mcdonalds getting a burger fries and drink or $10 for an all-you-can-eat tasty indian buffet? no contest! where we live theres no way youre getting anything decent (ie - not fast food) for under $10 for lunch so i thought the cost was absolutely reasonable a tad pricey for dinner but definitely tasty! the naan is served hot from the tandoor and the chicken tikka masala is among the best ive had (although the cubes of chicken breast were more like large chunks) if you like paneer (indian curd cheese) definitely try the paneer jalfrazie finally the mango lassis are outstanding with lots of mango flavor! love this place well worth the drive to the west side ive eaten here about four times  only for dinner ive had their veggie samosas chicken tikka masala chana masala chicken vindaloo tandoori chicken mango lassi and naan ive dined-in three times and was seated pretty quickly however one night i came to pick up my to-go order on a friday evening and waited about 30 min (which was in addition to the time they told it would be ready) at any rate its delicious food and is an establishment i will continue to frequent i love ordering takeout from swagat! and of course its always best when you order a load of food and share with great friendsthis was some of the best chicken tikka ive ever had perfectly spiced and rich the samosas were delicate on the outside and a hearty mix of potatoes and peas on the inside the aloo mutter and chana masala were also fabulous! and everything was still piping hot after the drive homeand of course the best way to finish off indian is with an order of gulab jamun! our total came to about $70 which served the seven of us dinner (we were stuffed!) and we even had some leftovers totally reasonable!,4.0,8
The Dhaba,okay so i know you are wondering: whats with the 5 stars finethat skepticism is warranted so the answer is a very simple: grade inflationas in grade inflation for phoenix indian restaurants we all know the indian restaurants are terrible in phoenix in general so the ones that are pretty good deserve higher than normal grades   dont get me wrong my expectations were exceeded when i dined at the dhabaguru palace is still better and in regards to food i would say royal taj is slightly better but the dhaba is a strong 3rd place  and in terms of the overall total package i would rank the dhaba the 2nd best indian restaurant in the city the ambience reminds me of the contemporary small joints you see in nyc or sf  the restaurant is narrow yet not claustrophobic the style is contemporary with nice mood lighting to give it a comfortable lounge like feel to it  they have the standard flat screen television with bollywood playing there are two servers  there is a non-indian server and an indian server  luckily we got the indian server because the other one just seemed a little strange like the reviewer below said  i thought the service was pretty good no our waiter didnt exchange pleasantries or talk to us but he was efficient water was continuously replenished in our cups which was a nice change for an indian restaurant   a big hit with me were the plates and cutlery  they were all metal including the cups which provides an additional authentic feel of dining in india the water especially tastes cooler when its served in a metal cup  and just to avoid confusing people there are two parts to dhaba they have a fast-food like chaat place which is next door to its restaurant component we dined at the restaurant the food: the food was well prepared the texture especially was captured right the chicken tikka masala was creamy and not runny the quality of the chicken included thick chunks of white chicken breast the saag paneer had a nice smooth pureed consistency but it wasnt runny  my favorite aspect was the naan which had amlost a paratha texture to it with flaky layers yet it was baked and crunchy on the outside but wasnt burned the rice wasnt dry or overcooked like you receive at most indian restaurants  in terms of heat it was perfect it wasnt too hot or mild i though they really nailed it there so what was missing? flavor the food didnt lack flavor but it did lack that addictive quality that makes you want to come back by yourself and just chow down when you just got finished working out for 2 hours oh dont get me wrong food was tasty and far better than 90% of the indian restaurants in the valley including some vaunted favorites like dehli palace in tempe india palace on 35th and bell tandoori times and maharaj palace to name a few  the malai kofta was arguably the best in the city  the only weak dish was the saag paneer; yes they got the texture right but it was a bit plain and it could have used more spice  something that deserves mention was the chaat we ordered the samosa chaat  the chaat actually contained normal amounts of samosa as opposed to one small piece of samosa and just tons of sauce the samosa and the chole were very well prepared and it wasnt drowned in sauce it was also fairly big and it was more than enough to feed two peopleother things worth mentioning: we had two white guys playing the sitar and tabla talk about ironic but the fact is they were really good sothere was a live music component  the place was also packed and there were people waiting outside to enter which i have never seen at an indian rest in the valley  so something is working finally the food was priced fairly we ordered 3 dishes 2 naan 1 rice 1 appetizer and two soft drinks for $44not bad for an indian restaurantthe same would have cost us about $10-$15 at another indian restaurant this place is worth taking a date to or  a group of friends as its ambience is hip enough that if you dont like the food your friends wont think you took them to some cheap restaurant  in other words its a good place to take people who have never eaten indian food  my recommendation is that you arrive before 7:30 because after that the place gets packed  if you go before 7 the crowd is mostly non-indians and the date crowd  after 7 you have large groups of indian families dining and so the waiting line can be extensive and the tables can get packed  my only criticism (if there is one) is the lack of enough of waiters and the length of time it took to bring the food out we ordered our food at 7:05 and didnt receive it until 7:40 and the place wasnt busy at the time therefore i could imagine that it could get much worse if you get there past 7:30 or 8 pm on friday and saturday before beginning with my review i would like to critic (!!) on something that i read through a lot of reviews here for the dhaba there is no f* variable spice level in indian food  i get enraged when people say these things as if these are the conventions for food most of the indian recipes ( 99% at least ) are prepared with a predetermined spice level  how do you want your food mild medium or spicy ?  is the dumbest thing i have come across in my entire restaurant life there are some recipes that are supposed to be spicy and some are supposed to be medium and some sweet reason being indian spices range way more than just chilly for heavens sake thai restaurants vary spice level just by adding more chili indian spices are way more than just chili and you can not add / subtract spices like chili sauce since spices are added during the process of cooking and not on top as garnishing in short mild medium or spicy is like asking what kind of a football player do you want for your team  fast faster or fastest   well quarterback position needs a fast player tight ends could be faster but wide receivers need to be the fastest but you can not f* switch and play the game !all right about the restaurant my opinion is that if you wish to have real indian food you have to go to cities other than phoenix (or even better go to india !) i have been to some indian restaurants in houston washington dc new york san diego new jersey and a few more places and all places have much better indian restaurants than in our valley but if it comes to sticking to the choices we have around i would rank the dhaba as the most close to actual indian food that you have get  jewel of the crown ranks probably the second but overall all indian restaurants around here are good for some particular things on the menu and worse for others  dhaba comes to being better for almost everything on the menu chicken tikka masala (butter chicken) related dishes are very good all lamb dishes are nice and authenticated vegetarian options are awfully limited compared to what it should be considering its an indian restaurant ( common restaurants in india have at least 40 more vegetarian items on their menu no kidding !)but overall i am very pleased with the range of quality here at the dhaba garlic naans are way too good to resist tea (complimentary) is very close to what people in india drink almost all non-vegetarian dishes and paneer tikka masala or mixed vegetables are tasty (somebody wrote about salads and i would like to remind that salads are not indian because other green vegetables are very common in regular diets)and yeah if you like indian music they have live music these days on the weekends i guess and though i have never been there for the music i bet that would be cool after dining here a couple of more times i would have to give this restaurant 35 stars the chicken tikka was very disappointing it was not served on a sizzling clay plate as it should be the chicken did not taste grilled  it was microwaved and served on a plate the flavor was also lacking honestly this is very amateurish and they simply cannot serve tandoor like thisalso the water was not served chilled with ice it was served tapwater temperature and thus your thirst didnt feel quenched  the vegetarian sabjis outside of palak panner and malai kofta was average again i dined here two more times after this and the quality of the food took a dip i walked into this place thinking: oh man you know the americans(white dudes) are going to love this place  flat screen tvs nice tables friendly service trendy ambience waiters who speak good english white guy playing sitar at the frontthis is white guys paradiseunfortunately the food itself was just above average fyi indians from india (my parents) call all white dudes americans as if we are not americans but i thought would throw some humor your way in case you were already bored reading the typical the spiciness wasnt there reviewin terms of the menu i dont think dhaba knows how its trying to position itself are they a chaat house a classic indian restaurant a fusion indian restaurantand that is the problem with this place its  a smorgasboarda jack of all trades yet a master of none  and thats exactly felt in the cuisine the samosa chaat was amazing the other chaatbleh!  the chicken tikka masa was very good but the certainly not crave-worthy meaning  it lacked thehey im dying for some great chicken tikka masala let me order this to go quality its really hit or miss with their dishes as some are completely amateur like their chicken tikka(not the curry but the grilled version) which tasted like chicken cooked on a forman grill and was then allowed to cool to room temperature and served on a platenot exactly appetizing their daal was really good but their saag was okayand to wendi below we dont eat salads  indian people created salads for you guys so when you tell me there is a new salad on the menu each day i envision someone at a chinese restaurant saying we are offering a different style of pizza today thats a not a good thing if the guy is listening to pink floyd that means the dial is moving even further away on the authentic meter whats next are they going to start offerring hooka and childs chicken finger and fries plate?dont get me wrong dhaba is one of the few indian restaurants in phoenix that i will actually dine at since most are terrible and thats not me being critical phoenix is a great place for bad indian restaurants to thirve since the population is clueless when it comes to indian food and you could seriously serve up some ground beef with curry and give it a name and they would think its a legitimate and authentic dishand this goes for the white dudes living in london who comes on these forums and tells us they know great indian food when they give places like india gate 5 starsbut i digress okay so if you are not an indian food snob and want to break out of your routine of eating at black angus this is a good place to start if you have eaten great indian food and are not easily mesmerized by a nice atmosphere go down mcclintock and take a left on broadway and try royal taj now with so many good things going for it i did leave the dhaba slightly indifferent you see when i order and eat im pretty much a total top while i am open to suggestion i have a good idea of what i want and how i want it during my visit not only was i flipped but i didnt have much say in the matter please dont get me wrong our server was friendly however every time when one of us ordered something he would tell us that he would order something better for us to enjoy for me i was dead set on ordering several wraps and rolls called sada bahar what i ended up with was far from what i originally envisioned while i did get my way with a few appetizers i have to say not only was i pleased with his domineering ordering selections but would eagerly let him order again for mestreet food called chaat is to indian cooking as dim sum is to chinese usually a small plate with around 3 servings varying in preparation and with enough variety to make a meal out of starting with the amritsri samosa chaat ($6); these are a deep fried triangular dumpling filled with a mixture of potatoes onions and chili served with a spicy yogurt sauce perfectly crunchy and not a drop of oil just breaking into one of them was a delight as the fragerent steam escaped it was aromatherapy indian styleambala tiki chaat ($6) was more of a composed small plate a couple of potato pancakes layered with garbanzo beans onions and garnished with fresh mint & tamarind chutney and yogurt the flavor components with indian cooking are generally very complex this plate was a great example of complexity and harmony each bite had varying degrees of spicy and sweet then a slightly sour finish from the chutneycomplexity doesnt quite work like with the kolkata pani puri ($6) these are round hollows fried crisp and served with a watery mixture of tamarind chili and potatoes the idea is to spoon in some of the mixture into each puri then pop into your mouth while the texture was nice the flavors just never came together and ended up just tasting weirdthis is the part where he took over and assured us what he was ordering was going to be quite good as the dishes came out we werent quite sure what was what so we just dug in eventually we got clarity and just continued to share family stylearriving on a sizzling iron skillet covered with peppers and onions the chicken tikka kabob ($11) was not only a dramatic presentation coming from the kitchen but the colors were vivid and bright large pieces of boneless/skinless chicken breast are rubbed with spices then grilled resulting in a beautiful yellow color the chicken was tender and moist yet had a slight smokiness that added another welcome dimensionserved in a large basket were piles of hot freshly baked naan ($3 per order) the thick and tender bread was a welcome site since i was wanting a wrap to begin with plain garlic and chili each flavor welcomes dipping wrapping and scooping of sauces and meatsloving yogurt the creamy tang of the kashmiri chicken tikka masala ($10) was a welcome surprise this is where the naan really came into play by making good use of the tender pieces of chicken and yogurt sauce sopping up as much of the delicious sauce as i could interactivity is just part of the experiencewith so many different spices and spiciness the mango lassi ($3) was as welcome as the rain yogurt and water mixed with sugar and mango was cooling and refreshing with the addition of a fruit puree on the inside of the glass made this version different than others ive tried though the effect was still the sameat the end of the meal we were brought out a bowl of rice pudding with a scoop of pistachio ice cream while the sliced dates and papaya were pretty to look at none of the flavors made much sense together complaining aside this did arrive complimentary who knows maybe for being a good sports?we were also brought out another off menu item it was a thick flaky and buttery paratha similar to a flour tortilla this particular version was filled with pureed cherry and sprinkled with anise seeds after only one taste we were hooked the group of us made short order of the warm tender layers you might have to ask for this one to be made special our server actually told us how soldiers in the hills of afghanistan would make these since it didnt take to many ingredients or tools he stared blankly out the window as he told the story perhaps of his own personal experience building make shift clay ovens?alright so sometimes letting go can be a hard thing to do after this experience its actually kind of nice sitting back and enjoying the surprises the kitchen has in store by far the best indian food ive had since moving to arizona  the chicken tikka masala and vegetable korma are my go-to favorites every timethe only negative about the dhaba is that it can be somewhat slow in the service department it actually adds a bit to the mellow feel of the atmosphere there but if youre in a rush its probably not a good choicethe food is always worth the wait i recommend the chicken tikka masala! it has a small quaint atmosphere this is your basic nice indian food spot the dhaba was a real treat!  i went on a weekday evening about 8:30pm and was surprised how busy it was  first good sign the two of us were immediately seated and served chilled water in the most interesting copper goblets  a selction of chutney and papadum came right away as well  the hostess was also our server she took our beverage order while we began a strategy of what to order  the menu was very extensive and contained many items i had never heard of before despite the wide array of choices we stayed pretty basic choosing a paneer masala chicken tikka a savory chick pea dish and of course basmati rice and naan  the meal came quickly and was the freshest i think i have ever had  every bite was phenomenalfrom the service to the dishes and everything in between made this experience truly memorable  i cannot wait to go back!!the only thing i would change- now i am being hyper critical would be the lighting  it was very bright for an evening meal  i guess it made me appreciate the appearance of the food easier last night was my first time at the dhaba and i will definitely be back! we had a reservation for 3 at 7:30 on a wednesday night and were not seated until after 8pm this is my only complaint about the restaurant after eating there it was definitely worth the waitwe ordered tandoori chicken chicken korma chicken tikka masala lamb vindaloo and rice and naan of course the portions look small and we did not take home any leftovers but we were full to the point of bursting when we left we also had a bottle of wine and i intended to try the chai masala but i will have to save it for next time the meal itself was by far the best indian food i have ever had i tend to gravitate more towards masalas and vindaloos for the most part and theirs were excellent but i was absolutely blown away by the korma nutty creamy sweet spicy - perfect! i scraped the bowl and my plate clean with naan and will go back for this dish alone over and over and over againthe service was friendly helpful while ordering and unobtrusive throughout the rest of the meal which i like my water stayed full and that was all i needed having to wait after making a reservation was initially somewhat off-putting but this minor annoyance was forgiven the moment we tried the food maybe next time we will make a reservation slightly earlier than we want to eat dhaba is amazing! the chicken tikka is delish! ive gone 3 times with an indian friend who also says its some of the best shes had in the valley the place is charming and food is great they offer a lot of deals on different sites (restaurantcom & groupon-like sites so look for them!) yum yum! i think maybe the bf and i are cursed i believe that this restaurant is awesome but we just came at the wrong day and time we went here tonight with a deal chicken deal that was like 44$ for 92$ worth of food that included: four beers/glasses of wine two apps two mains two sides two desserts and two chai teas well the place was overrun by a table of about 20 so the service was slow and they ran out of chai only having enough to give us like half of one glass also they only brought us each one drink so i felt like that was kind of lame especially considering we had to pay tax and 18% tip on 92$ worth of food when we really got maybe 65$ worth of food pretty lame other than that the place was good we got the fried paneer which i actually wasnt a huge fan of kind of bland but then ive never had paneer so that may just be what it tastes like the app with the fluffy bread and chickpea curry was really good the bread was almost like a savory donut or something yum for mains we got chicken tikka masala and  lamb korma i usually love the ctm but i think the pieces of chicken were too big which made them kind of dry and not as flavorful as it could be the lamb korma however was wonderful! the meat was super tender and the curry was great they also had good basmati rice and garlic naan for dessert i got their ice cream which is more ice -y than creamy almost like frozen rice or something but it was very good the bf got the rice pudding and enjoyed it we also enjoyed the chai (what we got of it anyway) so i would probably return and eat way less food but maybe ill be more picky when it comes to using deals at this place as it didnt really turn out to be a deal at all the dhaba is the indian restaurant that i frequent almost monthly yes i order the same two dishes all the time because theyre very good chicken tikka masala and butter chicken (theyre soo good!) unfortunately here they pretty much taste the same its not the best indian food ive ever eaten but it sure is one of the better indian restaurants in the valley ive also tried the spinach chicken/saag was pretty disappointed (came out very bland and no spice at all) maybe it was an off night for this consistency is very important to me in a restaurant and usually this place delivers 4 stars for creating tasty food and great naan overall but lacking that extra deliciousness for a perfect score  service is good you will have multiple servers throughout your dining experience this is often a good thing! the downside: theres usually a long wait on the weekends very long wait! if youre on the fence about trying it id say just go for it! youll most likely enjoy it! at least i keep coming back for more i enjoyed my trip to the dhaba  i have never eaten indian food before so my wife wanted me to try it because she loves it so much  we ordered a veggie platter which was amazing  the fried onion treats were exceptional  the chicken tikka masala was also very good  unfortunately the lamb boti kabab was very disappointing  it was so dry and tasteless no joke it was like boot leather  i even asked the waitress if it was supposed to be that dry and she said everything here is well done but quite honestly that was a disgrace  lamb should be moist and delicious this was like steak that you get at dennys at 2:30amas a side note there gulab jamun was breath taking  im not a desert guy but i would suggest this to anyone trythe dhaba is on http://wwwrestaurantcom/ so you can get a great discount and i would give the green light to try it just dont order the lamb this place was tried on a whim which had to do with all the rave reviews while i enjoyed the food it is far from the best indian cuisine ive had in the valley my husband had never really had indian so i was excited to expose him to my favorite dishes the veggie platter was delicious as was the chicken tikka masala my only complaint was the lack of chicken in the dish  we ordered the lamb boti kabab and i was disappointed the juicy tender lamb i was expecting ended up being dry and leathery the waitress offered no apology except to tell us that everything is cooked well done this was beyond well done  the highlight of the evening was their gulab jamun! so light and delicate and perfectly cooked!  would i go back? perhaps but i think ill keep hunting for better indian restaurants in the east valley we (husband and i) love the dhaba our first two visits were pretty different from each other so we waited until our third visit to formulate a solid opinion on the place its a very thorough four stars for us!the food is five-star good its that simplewe love the crisp cumin-laced poppadums (spelled many ways once translated to english: pappadams papadums etc) they serve while you wait for your order and the choice of three sauces husband dips with the chili sauce; i mix the sweet tamarind sauce and the chili saucetheir chicken tikka masala contains very tender chicken and consistently has a nice spice blend level of cilantro and velvety texture we find it sometimes has a little less chicken in it than the chicken makhani (makhani murgh) and husband isnt a sauce guy but he orders it every time anywaythe murgh makhani (often translated as butter chicken) is tied for the best ive ever had the sauce is a rich as the name would suggest blend of butter pureed tomato and cream and it is studded with plump golden sultanas (not raisins guys--these are not hard chewy blobs) and cashews the chicken has its trademark bright red skin and is so so so tender seriously so tendertheir mango lassis are the best ive ever had and ive had indian all over the place--nyc london they are thick fruity and perfectly sweet which means not overly sweet not under-sweetenedthe garlic naan is superb; we always order two they use real minced garlic and it is always a nice balance of crisp and tender no gummy naan at the dhabagreat gulab jamun but like most indian places they cost quite a bitthe service is where i quibble--the staff are super nice and super personable the kitchen just seems to be slow our first visit we waited a longish time but not so much that we noticed anything out of the ordinary on our second visit we waited a full fifty minutes from the time we ordered to the time we received any food--naan included it all came out together fifty minutes after we ordered it eek there were only a few other patrons in the restaurant at the time too the food was still blow-our-minds good so we decided to give them one more chance and were glad we did because the wait was very reasonable our third time and the staff especially attentive (and they brought the naan out for us to graze on while we waited--perfect)in short--eat at the dhaba the food is outstanding the wait time is tolerable and the staff are kind we absolutely loved the dhaba  from the moment we walked in we knew we were in for a treat  its a quaint little restaurant in the indian plaza and the place settings were what really caught my attention  now heres a little breakdown of my rating:- service  extremely friendly family oriented and always knew when to come to the table  drinks were refilled accordingly and the owner is so darn nice  she gave great suggestions and even brought out a surprise dessert for my fiances birthday  - food  we ordered:udta panchi - chicken wings marinated in dhaba spices and baked in a clay oven  absolutely delicious and extremely moist!  garlic and khasta keema naan (minced lamb stuffed naan)  the textures were wonderful  lightly crispy on the outside and delectably soft and chewy on the inside  the chutneys were delicious as wellchicken tikka masala - of course a signature dish of most indian restaurants  it was flavorful and had great body  smothered this on rice and scooped it up with the naans and youve got yourself one killer meal!sikandri jhinga saag (shrimp and spinach with herbs and spices - almost like an indian creamed spinach - just no cream) - light and flavorful and accompanied the other dishes quite well  great with the naan and a little bit of chutneythe only reason i wouldnt rate this restaurant 5 stars is because i would actually like to experience the consistency of their service and food quality  there are many fantastic indian restaurants ive been to and although i loved dhaba - it still comes in a close second to another indian restaurant that i enjoy going to out here in vegas  but ill tell you what - dhaba was unforgettable my fiance and i still talk about our meal so maybe they do deserve that extra star  ;) huge menu! if youre new to indian food be prepared to be confused waiter was helpful with recommendations chicken tikka masala was delicious as was the garlic naan the vindaloo was spicy! it comes at a 10 spice level i took one bite and my head decided to go swimming in my sweat good thing is they keep the place extremely chilly and serve water in these metal cups that keep the water ice cold service was also great they kept that ice cold water refilled as i was trying to put the fire out in my mouth the dhaba is perfect i could leave it at that but i wont the atmosphere is nice i love their cutlery and plates and tables my husband and i love their papdi chatt appetizer chicken tikka masala is amazing and another dish with spinach an chicken sorry  drawing a blank on the name every time we have been there our experience has been wonderful i will add one note i am hoping this was just a fluke but the last time we were in the owners were not there and the young indian girl working there had on club music so loud i could not here my husband speak at first i thought ok they just opened maybe theyll turn it off nope it played loudly the whole time also the bus girl and the indian girl just disappeared we needed water and there was no one around we waited 15 minutes plus for someone to get us our check we actually had to stop the girl to ask for the check because she just kept walking bywith this being said we still love the dhaba and will continue visiting often however if this ever happens again we might have to consider finding another place to get our indian food aaaah real indian and pakistani food!  im a snoot ill admit- after leaving chicago and devon avenue ive always been disappointed by what passes for indian out west but the dhaba blew me away i took some visit family here for dinner last weekend after reading positive reviews on yelp and was sooo not disappointed  first- and i love this because im lazy- you can make your reservation on yelp  literally three clicks and i had a reservation for four at seven  sure enough our table was ready and waiting for us- and i watched several other parties of various sizes show up and wait at least fifteen minutes to be seated so i was feeling smug before our lhassi was even on the table  service is a little patchy (we had to request water twice and flag down a waitress for our check) but the food is so dang good i dont even care  order whatever you want off the amazing huge menu- it will be good  i promise  my relatives had never had indian before (i know i dont get it either) so i steered them toward the traditional favorite chicken tikka masala  we requested it mild and i think our server translated that correctly to for old white people  the relatives loved it and i looooved my kafta and the fact that when you say i want it spicy!  the kitchen makes it spicy!    the portions are very generous which means lots of amazing leftovers to sit in your fridge and get even more spicy depth and flavor over the next day or two  and the rice pudding- deeelish!  the only thing that i wouldnt rave about was the masala chai tea and thats just because i like my chai blend with a little more punch and this had quite a bit of milk in it  the ambiance is lovely and perfect for a romantic evening a place to take your folks when theyre visiting and you want to prove youre all grown up or an upscale but not crazy-expensive girls night out i come here a lot the food is excellent! if your a fan of indian food this is a must try in my opinion i am working my way through the menu but the chicken tikka masala will always be my favorite and dont forget a garlic naan its delicious!the only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the spotty service depending on the night there may only be one waitress in the dining room and this place is usually busy so make sure you make a reservation! its just an over priced place with very little regard to service we had to wait for half an hour after which we got the table and the food took another half hour to come my husband ordered an extra roti which came after 25 mins of us just sitting and waiting staring at the entree!!! i ordered a kashmiri chicken tikka masala which was extremely bland my suggestion would be check out curry corner (just a block away) for half the price and way better taste all and all if you wish to blow your money on fraud tasteless indian food go ahead and try it my gf loves indian food me well not so much as it always seems to upset my stomachguess im not accustomed to all the spices that are used in indian food maybe that was tmi?? moving onhaving just moved to tempe i wanted to take my gf somewhere to eat and since she loves indian food i did a search on yelp the dhaba appeared to be a top indian spot according to yelpers i had seen it days before driving by it as it is hard to miss it hardly looks like a place that would serve indian food and rather more resembles some quirky old time western place from the outside i questioned whether it would be good based on this alone surprisingly the whole plaza is indian in some way indian market indian restaurant and an indian cafe wow! i probably would not have come here if it werent for the exceptional reviewsonce you walk into the dhaba the restaurant is quaint and beautifully decorated it was busy yet the atmosphere was quiet the hostess was attentive and the service was great the food was wonderful like i said im not a huge fan of indian food but i ordered the chicken tikka and i loved it the portions were big so unless you have a large appetite youll most likely have leftovers the food was a little pricey but it was worth it i look forward to going back again i wanted to go and eat at the curry corner a few blocks away but my friend who is a bit of a snob didnt want to eat at the cc so off we go to the dhaba  its in a nice location next door is a large indian market  the interiors of the dhaba is very nice with asian-inspired furnishings mostly dark wood  its actually a very intimate place they serve the drinks/water in a very artistic metal drinking glass  i ordered the chicken tikka masala samosa and my favorite garlic naan  my friend had mostly vegetarian the serving size were more than enough for two people  the waitress was very friendly and attentive  its really a must try for those visiting phoenix/tempe area and so i give it 5 stars i love this place! it is the best indian food ive ever had my husband had tried indian food before several times and was not a fan but after purchasing a groupon he agreed to try the dhaba and absolutely loved it it is a smaller restaurant with very cute décor and a relaxing atmosphere i recommend putting in a reservation especially if you go on the weekend some of our favorites are the rehriwale dahi bhalle kashmiri chicken tikka masala and lamb curry the fresh naan and rice are amazing the service is a little slow sometimes but the food is always stellar very good indian food this is first place i experienced indian  and i have been hooked ever since this is my go to spot for chicken tikka masalaits super flavorful and is always good  i do wish they gave more chicken in the dish  but its a good because i usually use the remaining curry for my basmati ricemmmm  the service is fast! i call in my orders and i never have to wait which is a plus my addiction  for indian curry is quite abnormallol but nonetheless  i can always count on getting a great meal here this place isnt bad the atmosphere is nice and the staff seems friendly enough but they are getting three stars for a couple reasonsfirst when we finally ordered it took quite a while for our food to come out also when we ordered we ordered some drinks normally those would come out before the food? so yeah when our food came out and we still didnt have drinks i had to ask twice for themsecond i ordered the chicken tikka masalla one of my all time favorite indian dishes if done right this dish came out under seasoned no real flavor whatsoever plus i really like spicy food so i ordered it as a 10 (scale of 1 to 10) unfortunately it didnt taste like they had done anything to spice it uplast the rice pudding was ok however they apparently leave whole cardamon seeds in there and i happen to bite full on into one thinking it was one of the nuts in the puddingmy wife had some ice-cream desert that tasted like a mango lassie but it was so rock solid and in a dish that just didnt work trying to dig pieces of the ice-cream off ended with the entire puck (thats about what it looked like) flying out of the small bowl they put it inon the plus side the garlic naan was fabulous in fact we got a second order of it anyhow i doubt ill come back here again especially if i can find a much better indian place closer to chandler excellent foodnaan was excellent along with chicken tikka masala i had an excellent experience with my friend here a couple weeks ago caution: the menu is huge i dont even know what i ordered i kept asking the waitress and then was like sure i do know we had the appetizer sampler again no idea what it was but ooooh so yummymy friend got chicken tikka masala with no heat but it was still really good i got a seven and by then end of the night i felt the burnthe mango lassi were soothing and deliciousplus we got a discount from google so we were happy but we forgot our leftovers  i was so saddefinitely recommend this place this restaurant is the only place i go for indian food oh my goodness!!!! the staff is so nice and the food gives me random cravings almost everyday haha! i recommend the chicken tikka masala at a number 4 or 5 hotness level! mmmmm its a little place that makes a date night very intimate or a lunch with a friend very personable i had two friends that had never tried indian food before so i took them here and they were in shock haha definiately a great place to go if you are going friday or saturday night make a reservation there are a lot of other people who have the same opinion as me :) oh and most plates are around $15 so a little up there but definitely worth it! the dhaba is my go-to indian good place i love it!!! it is the best indian food ive had in the valley its very small and i recommend making a reservation in advance to be safe on occasion they do put out a groupon that is insane! foods i recommend:chai tea (free refills!)chicken tikka masalapaneer tikka masalalamb vindaloogarlic naanraita i bought a groupon to the dhaba and my fiance and i used it a few weeks ago  it was really nice  i liked the decor  the place is a bit smaller than i expected but very cute  i had the chicken tikka masala and it was excellent  spiced just right for me  i asked for it at a 5  my fiance had sag lamb and he liked his as well  i had garlic naan  it was a little dryer than i like but still pretty goodwe went next door to the shop and it was pretty cool to look around  we will be back 31/2 really i tried dhaba for the first time today i ordered the chicken tikka masala which was good and garlic naan which was ok they deliver so thats always a plus for me im looking forward to trying some other things,4.03125,32
Kebab Mahal,i miss you a lot im glad that when i get back all the tourists will be gone and we can rekindle our lovei will ask for a chicken tikka masala and i will carress and love it before inhaling it and licking the plateplease behave while im gone excellent curry in a family run establishment with a total of six tables  the service is quick and the food is great  we had chicken tikka masala (excellent) and lamb bhuna (very good) thank you yelpsters for a great tip it would be easy to mistake kebab mahal for just another place that sells processed shaved meats its unassuming and dated appearance not doing it any favours however the old saying is true - one should not judge a book by its coverthe food is excellent - from the mild rich and creamy chicken tikka masala to the more spicy madras or vindaloo which have a good balance of heat and flavour and real kebabs the only thing ever to take me by surprise is that the chicken pakora is on the bone - delicious but something to be aware ofto sum up yes it can be very busy is small and looks dated however if you want good food at a good price kebab mahal is one of the best places to get a curry in edinburgh and i for one hope it never changes do not judge a book by its cover and certainly do not judge kebab mahal by its appearance! it will reward you with one delightful indian food experience from the chicken tikka karahi to lamb tikka bhuna every plate is delicious and generous on  the size accompanied with a couple of nans and you have an unforgettable ethnic feast! our meal ended with a baklava and a kataifi which was equally delicious and we hardly reached a £24 bill best indian in edinburgh for sure and if you know the cardinality of the set indian restaurants in edinburgh that says a lot im sad this place is so well known i thought it was my friends and i  are own little secret but since the cat is out of the bag i am yelping it this place is hands down the best curry shop in the whole city its the perfect little hole-in-the-wall and when i first walked by it i took one look at it and knew this place was going to be good my saudi friend then took my here and i was hooked! i was ready to come wash dishes in exchange for food! what can i recommend? all of it seriously  but the creme of the crop ischicken tikka masala the creamy sauce with the melt in your mouth chicken drool sooooooo good the owner is the kindly gentleman with the big white beard so if you see him tell him how wonderful his food is and his establishment because i always always see him working there and all that hard work has paid off to blossom this place into the best curry this side of india or pakistan hands down!,4.8,5
Curry House,i have been a fan ever since i decided to try the curry house finally a restaurant within the vicinity of my home!i have been to my share of indian restaurants and let me tell you i am finally happy to say that there is one up to par with my standards phoenix does not offer various culinary adventures or restaurants that make my taste buds water by just hearing the name curry house has proved me wrongthe chicken tikka masala is impeccable and curry house offers various other dishes as well i suppose the reason why i adore it so much is because the food tastes like food you could get in india many other restaurants try to emulate this style but curry house has succeeded not bad stopped in to grab some take-out chicken tikka masala and naan the sauce was very good as was the naan but the chicken felt as though it might be under-cooked i was surprised that i didnt get any rice or anything with the tikka masala just a tub of chicken in sauceill happily give them another try though when i have time to eat in the sad thing about reviews of phoenix indian restaurants are made by non-indians and others who have no real experience with indian food the reviews of curry leaf are an example of that  this is not a restaurant by any means  this is fast food indian  the food was bland and tasteless  im indian so i know what im talking about  i ordered a chicken tikka masala wrap  the chicken was dry and had little sauce it was also expensive  it was made by some auntie who has no experience cooking; she is not a professional cook  i hate to write this review because the people were nice and its in a nice convenient location but i was very disappointed  it really looked as if a couple quit their jobs and decided to open an eatery  it was very cheap looking and they charged a lot of money for very subpar food i know we need more indian restaurants/eateries in the phoenix area but at the same time we should have standards this place would clearly not be in business in a city with several quality indian restaurants like dallas houston ny chicago la and sf have,3.0,3
Flavors of India,time has not been kind to flavors of india  i just went back for dinner after a couple of years of inadvertently overlooking this place  it appears that the management has changed and foi is not better for itperhaps the lunch buffet is still a good deal for the quality and quantity of the food they serve  for dinner its offensive to charge $99 for a side of rice to go with an order of chicken tikka masala  its not an issue of the cost but the principle of the matter  obviously im going to order the rice  just up the price of all the dishes by a buck and throw us a bone with free rice  and nearly $3 for a bowl of soupy raita?  they need to change the name of this place to nickel and dime       farewell flavors of india farewell! i have had excellent luck with this place by always following the same formula  order mid-week get the chicken tikka masala and the lamb kwarma order both at least medium preferably spicy  ask for an extra side of rice i have always gotten it at no extra charge and the portion of entree does require more rice  always order garlic naan probably two orders  this method will easily feed six people or yourself for a couple days i cant comment on the complaints expressed by others as i have never tried flavors of india their way my way i have always been on the verge of food romance pants explosion i have to start out this review by saying i never had indian food before i ate here so i didnt feel i could give it a fair review until i tried a few others around town first  well now that i have i have to say that flavors of india is the best indian food in phoenix bar none!first off when you walk into an ethnic food restaurant and the place is filled with people of the same ethnicity and the place is really quiet because everyone is busy enjoying their food you know its a good place to eat  is it a bad thing when the host/manager recognizes you when you walk in and remembers your order?  youd think we eat there a lot or something  ive found my favorite dish is the chicken tikka masala medium spicy and if you like shrimp the shrimp tikka masala is just as yummy!  we usually order a side of the paneer kulcha (unleavened bread stuffed with indian style cheese) which is wonderful to sop up the extra yummy sauce after you are finished  portion sizes dont appear to be too large but we always have leftovers  and its always better the second day too!the service is top notch the food is excellent and the best part of the dining experience is the bollywood music videos playing on the flat screen!  dinner and entertainment all in one!  ftw!!!  i cant wait to go back! im giving this place a generous 4 stars because the food is actually very tasty ive been here twice now and im never disappointed indian food has to be on the top of my list for favorite cuisines and i am sad to say there arent many or any great indian restaurants that i have found in phoenix flavors of india however seems to satisfy my palate i enjoy the chicken tikka masala every time i have also tried the curry chicken which is also very tasty the chicken is very fresh and tender both the light and dark meat the naan is a bit flat and not soft or chewy enough for my taste but it does its job i really enjoy their basmati rice its not the most elaborate or flavorful ive ever had but for some reason im drawn to it and even crave it theres no saffron or cloves; its a bit on the simple side and just a tad bit sticky the samosas are decent although i have had better if you are in the mood for some indian food and this place is close by i suggest you head on over prices are reasonable two can eat for 30 bucks including multiple appetizers the food is prepared quickly its not the prettiest of restaurants but it has its interesting indian decor with a twist of mexican thrown in at least thats my impression i dont like that they are closed on sundays since thats when i typically like to eat indian food the quantity is definitely sufficient and you will have left overs unless you like to pig out   try it youll probably like it! when the boyfriend and i get home after a long tiring day and we just need to curl up with some comfort food we invariably agree on chicken tikka masala from flavors of india its the best and the standard size feeds 2 easily with rice and naan they used to give me a bit of a hard time for always getting the same thing but theyve let up to be fair ive only gone there for takeout but they always have cool bollywood movies playing in the background wide range of vegetarian options great chicken tikka masala! very friendly and attentive staff if youre into bollywood this place plays videos too reliable quick and accomodating  its probably not the best or most authentic out there but when you hae a hankering for chicken tikka masala they really do make the best  they are good at accomodating changes (i always get half chicken half paneer) and they have a great mango lassi that doesnt taste like it came out of a premade tub  little pricey though flavors is easily my favorite indian restaurant in the valley with friendly wait staff good prices and fantastic food you cant go wrong dont be fooled by its humble exterior; its the food youre there to enjoy i prefer to skip the buffet as i like my food xxxx-indian-hot but i have never been disappointed at dinner in fact the staff recognize me and my daughter and often ask if well have our regular even if its been months since our last visit my absolute favorite is the lamb vindaloo while my husband has chicken korma and my daughter goes for the chicken tikka masala and a mango lassi dont forget the rice pudding (kheer) for dessert you wont be disappointed!!! i mostly do take out i love the food and the service i have tried a lot of indian restaurants but their samosa garlic naan and chicken tikka masala are great  enjoy!!! what a great find ive been searching for years for a place like this sketchy from the outside but worth the wait and that you will do ordered chicken tikka marsala (6 on spice scale could have gone to an 8) and the lamb vindaloo (also a 6 more fairly spiced) with the garlic naan oh la la that hit the spot the restaurant is dim and loud from nearby tables but cute and comfywe will be back and im not sure i would even waiver from my original selection it was that delicious feel safe with this selection on flavor and atmosphere but step out of the box for more flavor with the spices theyve changed their chicken tikka masala recipe at least twice since my original review and each time ive liked it less the sauce used to be creamy now it looks like theres no cream in it and it separates easily so the fat floats on the top ill have to find another restaurant to sate my chicken tikka cravings on occasion i crave indian food this is not the best nor the worst ive had but i too concur that foi isnt at the same level as it has been in the past the servers and preparers are exceptionally polite and lovely but the food was not as flavorful and savory and i remember as i pick at the mango pudding and the carrot pudding (which seems like a dessert that is sweetened and full of butter) i will go over the highlights and lowlights of my culinary adventure- i enjoyed the spinach/cheese mixture; one of my go to dishes the chicken tikka was ok and the tandoori chicken was a b on the flip side the assorted fritters had seen fresher days and the vegetarian/cabbage dish was not very flavorful imho even with the big caraway seeds the seeds were huge - to the point i was routinely picking them from my dish kudos to yelp which enabled me to have another helping of mango pudding as i write this seeing how there are/were several indian diners here it cant be too bad great service and very good food  we ordered the lamb curry aloo mutter chicken tikka masala and garlic naan  everything was/spiced/seasoned to order just as we requested  the aroma of fresh garlic from the naan was outstanding  great portions and reasonable prices  need extra rice and they did not hesitate and did not charge  will definitely be back for the lunch buffet we went in for lunch today  parking lot was full and several people inside -- always a good sign that the food is goodwas planning on doing the lunch buffet but found out they dont have chicken tikka masala on buffet   sad pandaso we ordered chicken tikka masala with some garlic and plain naan  service was very good  the plain naan was excellent while the garlic was a little too garlic for our taste the chicken tikka masala was decent however it was more of a soupy texture instead of a paste that im used to always delicious! lunch buffet is so yummy fresh and full of choices (meat & veg) dinner menu is hard to choose from due to the extensive variety the chicken tikka masala is rich and flavorful definitely a favorite garlic naan is also a must! the atmosphere is clean and open and the wait staff are attentive and sweet i lololove this restaurant!,3.8666666666666667,15
Dhaba Indian Bistro,the chicken tikka masala is a great favorite  my two kids (ages 4 and 7) eat it like its ice cream the restaurant was hoppinga great new indian restaurant on the west side great indian?  my favorite part of this restaurant is their lunch menu (they dont do buffets) it is so affordable so you can take multiple items home to try!  for under $30 my hubby and i ordered the chicken tikka masala shrimp vindaloo lamb biryani (rice dish) garlic naan plan naan and extra raita  all meals come with their cumin toasted basmati rice!  we have enough for at least another meal and half!  i am so excited they opened  havent ate in yet dinning room looks nice and staff is always wonderful during counter service i stopped at dhaba for the first time this week  on the good side the restaurant looks very good and the staff is courteous and efficient  also our naan bread was delicious  on the bad side the very bad side the lamb vindaloo was inedible  it appeared to be canned tomato soup slightly spiced and heated with some lamb dropped in  terrible!  the chicken tikka masala was barely passable  i think the sauce also came from a jar at least it tasted like it  i cannot recommend this restaurant for anything other than naan  if you want indian any other indian restaurant in town would be better for all the people stating that this is the best indian food in madison i can only assume that they have not ever been to maharaja or swagat maharaja is the best indian restaurant in madison and we have been going there for years but to keep an open mind we have tried dhaba twice in the past month first of all the place itself is nicely decorated and the service is excellent the waitstaff are polite and attentive and there are plenty of them but the food is just not that good (other than the naan) every entree comes with either soup or salad we have gotten their lentil soup both times which is buttery thin and tastes very little like lentils however its not bad just not very interesting or lentil-yfor main courses we have had the chicken shahikorma and the chicken tikka masala as well as the spinach (ie palak) paneer (a combo of spinach and farmers cheese-like cubes) and spinach aloo (spinach with potatoes) the first time we tried the chicken shahikorma i was suspicious that the base of it was actually canned tomato soup with a few spices added seriously it was a very thin sauce with cut up chunks of nicely cooked chicken breast in it but the sauce was not like any shahikorma ive ever had and it was not interesting the second time we came we had the chicken tikka masala and strangely enough it had the exact same sauce as the shahikorma the two dishes should not repeat not have the same sauce and the chicken tikka should have been made with chicken cooked in the tandoor oven but there was no evidence that it had been we felt a little ripped off that the two dishes use the same sauce they should not the spinach dishes were ok except the potatoes in the spinach aloo were undercooked - as in crunchy i didnt eat them the naan is great i admit but the rest just is not that good seriously if folks want really good indian go to maharaja and get the chicken shahikorma or tikka there we decided to try it because of the good reviews its been receiving and we were very impressed! i dont pretend to be an expert on indian food but this is the best ive ever had i used to go to swagat (which is also good) and there were a few indian places i frequented when i lived in denver but this blew them awaythe garlic naan bread is a must were still craving it today i ordered the chicken tikka masala on a recommendation and it was awesome and my wife ordered the beef mushroom which was also excellent we ordered take-out and the food was ready very quickly and its also very reasonably priced plus they give you a 10% discount if you pay in cashwe have a 1 year old and are always looking for good take-out options dhaba might have just jumped to the top of the list! let me start by saying im indian and a bratty snob when it comes to indian food my family is punjabi like the family that owns the restaurant so i very much appreciated the mostly north indian menu food: yum! we have the non-veg appetizer platter (so good! keema samosa was one of the best ive had) we ordered malai kofta chicken tikka masala with garlic and chicken naan we later got some saag (spinach dish) and kheer naan - we ended up trying garlic chicken and plain naan all kind were great! malai kofta - best ive had in madison ive tried a few other places and they just dont hit the spot the way this one did chicken tikka masala - its the only chicken dish i think is ever worth ordering at an indian restaurant this dish was literally designed for indian restaurants its not authentic to india rather great britain  so i dont bother with anything else dhabas was reallllllly good!saag - my mom licked the bowl she was so in love with it kheer -  im not someone who usually likes kheer but we had some at the end and i stole my moms because it was just the perfect balance of sweet and creamy we ordered at a spice level 3 and found it perfect im not someone that loves spicy food (ie hyderabi goan pakistani food i cant handle you) however i do like some heat so the 3 was honestly just perfect for my mom sister and myself my mom was even having a little bit of a hardtime handling that but shes been cooking without much spice for the past year restaurant decor: i really like how theyve decorated it and appreciated the folk artwork and punjabi music playing in the background totally like a real dhaba (dhabas are the indian version of fast food joints you pull over on the side of the road to a usually sheltered/tented area at least in punjab & enjoy the whatever deep friend/sloppy delicacy you are offered usually some sort of comfort food back to the review)overall this place is awesome! im totally planning to cater for one of my wedding events from them! ps if you like taste of india on monroe street or brookfield/fox valley the owners family runs those locations as well two thumbs up! this is probably the best indian restaurant ive been to i would definitely recommend it  i got the chicken tikka masala and it was delicious affordable prices and good service as well they were very helpful for explaining what a lot of the food on the menu was on a recent search for a great local indian restaurant we discovered two within a mile of our houseboth are great but this one is our new favorite!  easy to miss from the street its worth the search to find  we have been back twice and service has always been prompt and personable  the food is equally fantastic!  my husband is a huge fan of their tandori chicken and myself love their mango chicken and chicken tikka masala  the dinner for two is a great deal and a fun way to try a few entrees too  the naan was also great as well as their lentil soup  we are looking forward to going back! all potential for disappointment gets checked at the door and never makes it inside the friendly owners portion-to-price ratio and succulent entrees make this place 5-star awesome a must for anyone who enjoys indian food this time while i waited the owner told me all about uttarayan one of indias many major festivals i brought home the chicken tikka masala (wifes favorite) and the chicken vindaloo along with the veggie appetizer sampler the samosas are a personal fav and i get those every time if for no other reason than the sampler of sauces they serve with them nirvana for me would mean being dipped in those sauces please dont eat me though the pakoras (fried veggies in a hummus batter) are also perfectly dippable and probably taste slightly better than i do  for entrees i ordered the masala mild but would step that up a notch next time the vindaloo was medium-plus spicy and perfect -- just spicy enough to make my forehead sweat but not so spicy as to dominate the flavor the chicken in both entrees was tender white meat expertly cooked eat here you wont regret it i just died and went to indian food heaven seriously though if i were on death row (that would suck but)this would come a very close second to my familys homemade cincinnati chili in the us its very difficult to find the quality of indian food you will find in the uk  yes the uk where i believe chicken tikka masala is going to be declared the national dish over fish and chips! you cannot turn a corner without smelling the indian food bliss slap you in the face and finally! i have found an indian restaurant that has met their match in the us of merica! dhaba indian bistro is ah-mazing! so what was for dinner you ask? lobster madras with garlic naan no lobster madras (a little spicier and more flavorful in my mouth) was not on the menubut they made it no questions asked i knew the vindaloo was too spicy and the masala too weak for my buds sothey just smiled and brought out a beautiful dish full of those indian flavors i have missed so much too bad theyre not in my hometown; id be there once a weekminimum we are always looking for a good indian restaurant; dhaba is okay but im not sure wed make a special trip to go there againwe began with samosas this is maybe my favorite appetizer snack there is theirs however was not up to par at all first they came out way too soon which means they were made previously and reheated (we were there for an early dinner as we did not have lunch) they were on the greasy side but the worst part was the taste they had no spice whatsoever ive had samosas just about in every major city in the country that has a population of people from southeast asia--and i expected some spice they were so bland it was like eating mash potatoes in a pastry (and very little texture as well) i do want to say that when we sent the back they were taken off of our billthe rest of the meal fared better; my husband and i shared an order of chicken tikka masala which was flavorful we also shared the vegetable mix curry which also was good the nan was a tad on the greasy side and cooled off very quickly becoming a cracker i think were still looking for that amazing indian restaurant this indian food is great consistent and delicious jump in and start eating!when dhaba opened in middleton it became our weekly take-out option ive never actually been to the restaurant as my co-worker always makes the pickup over the last six months we have rated each dish to our preferences here is our list of the best tasting meals that weve had sadly we have not yet eaten our way through the whole menu as long as dhaba makes food well continue eating our way through the menu weve gone heavy on the lamb and vegetarian dishes and skipped most of the chicken and beef that said here is our list of favorite dishes all dishes with an asterisk are my personal favs* apps====lamb samosa*mixed vegetarian platterbread====onion and pepper kulcha*garlic naanspinach naanbiryani rice=========lamb biryanilamb curries===========lamb vegetable*lamb masalachicken curries=====chicken tikka masalavegetables===========dal makhni*baingan bhartha*paneer masalamatter paneermalai koftatry dhaba and enjoy them for yourself my boyfriend and i absolutely love this restaurant! the service is quick and the wait staff is very friendly and professional try the garlic nann - it has cilantro i usually get the chicken tikka masala you can order the food from mild to spicy on a scale of 1-5 this was the first place i ever had indian food i greatly enjoyed the chicken tikka masala i went back quite a few times because i worked across the street ive since had other indian places and i can say this is the best ive had yet the cheese naan was on point the service was superb very friendly always they even let us know that they have off the charts spicy the hottest they have would rate maybe a 2 on the thai spice level so if you request off the charts they give you some extra spice to add on your own,4.285714285714286,14
Mantra Masala,indian food is one of my all-time favorites my experience is based on growing up eating at nycs curry row (6th st btwn 1st and 2nd ave) then the few years in my late 20s living in dirty jersey i was exposed to a ton of great indo-paki restaurants so why the background information? simply put im cynical and spoiled and didnt expect the desert to have such bombay (ha-ha) indian restaurants but we do!okay if indian cuisine was bad karaoke (metaphorically speaking) and there was a contest likeamerican idol; and i was on a panel with simon paula and randy i know we would unanimously vote mantra masala-healthy cuisine from india to be the next american idol theres never a wait and the prices are fair (dinner price-appetizer variety of nan main course and drink 20-30$ per plate) the service is prompt and extremely friendly tonight we brought a newbie to indian cuisine and the owner (i think she was the owner?) she was nice enough to explain whats what to our friend  tonight i had the chicken vindaloo and im still thinking about how awesome it was the nan & onion culcha is made on site piping hot and oh so good the samosa mixed appetizer is one you cant go wrong with i gauge my restaurant on the chicken tikka masla and mantra masala passes with flying colors the tikka & tandoori is spiced perfectly and always juicy the mango lassi and their taj beer are excellent (probably not together) this place is extremely vegetarian friendly im psyched they are getting ready to start a lunch buffet next week the place has doubled in size within the last couple of months its a clean place with a dark and cozy atmosphere the decor is a lot more modern then any other place ive been  if you like indian food you will be addicted to mantra masala this place is great!  gerald and i went there a week or so ago and really enjoyed the foodtheir chicken tikka masala was really good; the chicken was very flavorful and the curry was just right  it wasnt the best ive ever had but it was high up there and the chicken was just perfectwe ordered some appetizers (the sampling platter with the somosas and a few other things) and they were all quite good as well  the only thing i didnt like about them was they seemed to all be covered in a thin layer of salt  it tasted great but it was a bit saltytheir home-made tamarind sauce was delicious and went well with the appetizerswe also ordered a special eggplant dish that was also pretty good  gerald didnt care for it but i thought it was tastythe service was very good; the waiter was friendly and attentiveit was very quiet when we went; there were only one or two other tables the whole time  i hope that this place picks up because its among the best indian food ive had in las vegas although i had my doubts about mantra masala before actually eating there (the sign on the exterior says healthy indian food leading me to imagine creamless plates of tikka masala - ew) i was pleasantly surprised once i actually had the opportunity to eat there  the service was friendly and fast and the food was great  we had the appetizer sampler (fried goodness) chicken tikka masala lamb vindaloo garlic naan bread and we split a mango lassie   it was a little pricey compared to other indian restaurants that ive been to but it is close to my house and i will definitely go there again when im craving indian  one complaint i would have is that it took not one not two but three visits to the establishment before i could eat there due to their weird schedule  closed on mondays  closed during the afternoon during their off-peak hours  i get that it saves them money to close during this time but this is vegas and i would expect a restaurant to be open at 3 pm it probably speaks volumes about me that mantra masalas tagline as healthy cuisine from india! really put me off this restaurant for a long time  i wasnt sure i wanted to go out for healthy food but after two years of living a stones throw from this restaurant finally a craving for indian without the strings attached of driving around town won out and we gave it a shotoverall i am pleased we did theres no buffet on offer here but the dinner menu while small features some tasty fare i enjoyed my chicken tikka masala and the samosas were different (and rather heavy) from what i am used to but really excellent my wife enjoyed her shahi paneer and we both loved the papadums and naanthe portion sizes are fairly standard for an indian restaurant so dont expect usa sized portions and the prices are pretty reasonable without being bargain pricedmantra masala isnt my favourite indian place in town but its certainly convenient and a worthy contender for if you live nearby we love this place! try the aloo tikka - a great appetizer of potato cakes with sauce that my boyfriend tries to lick off the plate the chicken tikka masala is excellent as is the curry i have been to mantra masala 3 times for lunch and had their chicken tikka malasa and tandoori chicken lunch special every time  very yummy! love the tomato soup they serve with the lunch specials and their naan is really good i am a huge pakistanian/indian foodie so after reading the reviews i decided to try this place for dinner  i was from houston tx where there is an abudant of pakistanian/indian food around so my reviews below may be very criticalprosvery closenice decorconsfood-mantra mixed appetizer which includes the samosa onion bhaji and chicken pakora-----samosa:  filled with lentils i am used to the potatoes filling so didnt like this one-----onion bhaji:  just taste like fried batter to me-----chicken pakora: dipped in the tamarind chutneywhat do you get?  sweet and sour chicken!!!!  my piece of chicken fell out of the thick cold batter -mantra mixed grill (they are tiny portion like others have mentioned but its all good since its the quality that i want to try out at this place)-----barah kabob:  the part that was super grilled was ok but the middle part tasted kinda mushed in a way-----chicken tandori/chicken bazari:  i dont knowi tried other pieces that are not chicken tikka and it tasted kinda grainey so i stuck to the chicken tikka-----chicken tikka:  this taste the most familiar buti have not seen such a small piece -----masala chai tea:  it kinda taste like the bigelow spiced chai tea that i could easily steep at home office anywhereconclusion:  i will drive the further distance to go to my favorite indian restaurant here in vegas mint indian bistro ambiance- 4 starsfood- 35 starsprice- 2 starswe came here in a large group for dinner and the server was very helpful in helping us order our dishes  for an appetizer we had the mussels mantra the flavor was good but it was overcookeda lil tough and chewy we also tried the padpi chat i was definitely not a fan of this item for the entrees we decided on the sea bass the chicken tikka masala lamb mantra and the dewane handi out of everything the sea bass was my favorite flavored just right the lamb was dry and the dewane handi was bland to me i think my favorite part of the meal was the nan i wasnt too impressed with the meal and after we got the check it made me less impressed like i said before we had a large group (15 people) and it came out to be 41 dollars a personor 82 dollars a couple in our case im definitely not stingy when it comes to good food but for the price and what we got im not sure i will be returning unless its for the lunch specials i ate with brenda l on the same exact day and we happened to be at the same table eating the same thing!  haha!  anyhoo i think i totally had a different opinion of the food maybe because we had split all the dishes and they gave the birthday girl (me) the better cooked dishes? 1   mussels mantra - i thought that the mussels that i had were actually really juicy and tender  and the sauce!  oh the sauce!  i totally wanted to mop it all up with the naan!2  padpi chat - i didnt love this dish but i appreciated the tangy flavors and the crunchy bread3  sea bass - i thought this was actually overcooked and dry4  chicken tikka masala - i had the specially prepared one with extra spiciness  loved it and it was not dry5  lamb mantra - i enjoyed this dish a lot because it was actually really tender and not gamey at all6  dewane handi - this spinach dish did not impress me much and nor did i even remember eating it!  haha! out of everything the sea bass was my least favorite and my favorites were between the tender lamb and the fluffy yet crusty nan bread!  so good!  from what ive experience indian food is always pricier than other foods but i had such a good experience i guess the price was fine to me  conclusion:  im sorry that brenda l did not have as good of an experience as i did but i was a happy camper!  going back for more my first venture into attempting to find good indian food in vegas has ended in failure  it wasnt bad but it wasnt good  ive had better in fact  ive only had better than this and it has always been much cheaper  this is like the panda express of indian food with a really nice atmosphere (this should have been my first warning)  the total bill for two people came out to about $50  a few weeks ago i was in a pretty shady looking indian restaurant (most of the best ones are shady looking) in san francisco and we ordered a lot more it tasted better and the bill didnt even make it to $30if youre totally clueless about indian food and your idea of travel is driving down to mesquite then this place is probably perfect for you  unfortunately i didnt come to have american food with an indian theme i was looking for something that had the rich deep and complex flavors that im used to  the lowdown:naan - ahhh the king of breads naan bread usually whisks my senses away at the very first bite  im a bread lover and naan is easily one of the best types of bread in the world usually  this one was good  not great certainly not amazing like it should be just goodgarlic naan - i have to give them kudos on their garlic naan  it had a better flavor than many of the others ive had  garlic naan usually doesnt stack up against regular naan but this one was actually better than their plain naan  thats not the best compliment but its the only one theyre going to get today!chicken tikka masala - hmm like naan it is one of the dishes that i judge an indian restaurant on  usually rich creamy and surprisingly complex this one was decent  but a bit bland with none of the richness and depth that im used to  it was more like chicken campbells-tomato-soup masalachicken mantra - it tasted thin  like a watered down version of what it was meant to be  the flavor was actually decent but once again lacked richness and depth  the rice was a disappointment and a previous yelpers comment about it being a mouse sized portion wasnt too far off the mark  a big mouse to be certain but still a mouseit might be the best indian in vegas but i hope ill find better close to our house and great food must try the eggplant bharta and the chicken tikka masala two of the best dishes on the menu in a word: yummy! indian food tends toward the expensive side so i appreciate mantra masalas lunch special menu i went with lunch two featuring chicken tikka masala it comes with a side of dewane handi (spinach puree with assorted vegetables) some seasoned basmati rice and a decently sized piece of naanto be real its not a whole lot of food for $795 + tax but mantra preaches healthy food with that in mind its a good portion and definitely satiated my appetite without making me overly full and most importantly everything was delicious i prefer the flavor of mantras chicken tikka masala over mint indian bistros the naan was cooked perfectly and the dewane handi was surprisingly good (ive never had it before)i havent eaten dinner at mantra looking at the dinner menu prices i probably wouldnt want to for lunch however it presents a nice option it is a bit far from work but its a quick zip up the 215 ill definitely get lunch there again some daynote: a sign outside advertizes lunch specials under $6 this is misleading one lunch dish is $595 the rest are $795 or higher35 stars we grabbed lunch with a friend who lives in the area we all grabbed a lunch #2: chicken tikka dwane handi seasoned rice naan and tomato soup it was good but not the best chiken tikka was juicy but the tikka sauce seemed less complex than others dwane handi is good tomato soup was pretty standard naan was okay the portions arent that big but it did the trick i just was more sad about the tiny dollop of rice i mean isnt that the point of the rice and naan is to sop up the sauces and flavors of the dishes? by the end i was just taking spoonfuls of the dishes since i was out of rice and naan which to me is a travesty this asian has to have rice!!! $795 isnt bad for a lunch but with a lot of indian places offering a buffet for $9-11 it isnt necessarily value when compared but good value for being the only indian in the sw and few places with lunch specials thereservice wasnt really personable we didnt get any drink refills and when ordering drinks he took mine and the bfs drink order and turned around without asking our friend if they want a drink no drink for you! its okay if you want indian nearby but i think a drive out is worth it cant go wrong with the chicken tikka masala basmati rice and naan ordered take out for 8 people - the staff was friendly the owner helped me load my car and was expecially helpful when i asked for plates/utinsels/napkins overall very friendly and good food id certainly return! by far the best indian restaurant in our neiborhood sw i think this restaurant is ome of the better indian restaurants in las vegas great neiborhood restaurant to satisfy ur appetite my husband had lamb korma and it was very good and my chicken tikka masala is very good as well i never have a craving for indian food so we dont visit here often but whenever we do it doesnt disappoint us naan here are very good but paratha are just okay  one thing that did bother me this time is that the girl the server? did not offer a lunch menu which we didnt know it existed same thing that i ordered could have been $5 less it made me feel that i was screwed over so! i highly suggest you to ask for a lunch menu because they were not offering unless customers asked i went for dinner with 4 other friends a few nights ago the food was great the service well it wasnt intentionally bad i think but it was definitely lackluster immediately upon sitting we ask for 5 glasses of water he brings 2 glasses with no ice 10 minutes later we ask for ice 3 mango lassis and a coke 10 minutes later out come 1 mango lassi and 1 coke still no ice and still missing 1 mago lassi and 3 waters this is 30 minutes into sitting down it definitely was not because they were swamped there was only 1 other table seated in the restaurant he eventually brought us the remaining beverages and took our orderwe all ordered chicken tikka marsala with varying levels of spice but what we got was chicken tikka marsala all at medium level it was plain to see that they just made one batch and tried to pass it off at $15 a plate just for the marsala this is unacceptable actually as im writing this review im deducting another star 1 star for you mantra marsala what poor service! this place has the most amazing food! start off with popi-chat for an app then grab the chicken tikka marsala with two orders of naan bread with and extra side of rice! then finish it off with the most amazing desert  not sure what it is called but the owner made it for me  it has two scoops of his he made pasatico ice cream and this amazing little warm ball of something  omg!  it belongs in a spa!  not sure why but every time you take a bite (combine the two) it has this amazing taste that brings you back to a relaxing spa!  enjoy!  i normally go once a week! came here because it was close to where we live the food was horrible my wife and i are avid indian food lovers the prices are too high and the quality of food is not up to par ordered chicken tikka masala and veggie khurma  the masala tasted watered down the khurma had no taste and had strange veggies in it for the dish like green beans couldnt call this place authentic would not recommend to others my 2 cents the search for a good indian food restaurant continues for my wife and i this was the first place in vegas we tried im only giving one star because i have to to be able to rate the business ayayay where do i start ???veggie khorma had legumes in it and tasted nothing like a khorma no cauliflower no potatoes no green peas -_-chicken tikka masala was heavy in creamlacking spices cream is cheaper than spicesrice portion was a 3oz dish (from a nearby mandalay bay hotel & casino ((yes we flipped it over))) -_- my husband is 65 280lb (weve never had this prob anywhere else)raita (yogurt) portion was more than the rice but it had water mixed in and the seasoning was way offno cumin too much  anise seeds no cucumbers or carrots or spicesfood was yucky expensive and miniature no buffet?!?!?! wtf? thats like an indian rest stapleoh andwe complained to the waiter he said owner will be in later and there was nothing he could doas we were leaving the owner came and our waiter told him our problemhe said give me a minmy husband said were obviously not important enough so we left and im now venting on here shoulda caught me at the door buddy-boy!a bit of background ive probably ate at more indian restaurants around the world than anything elsei had an indian restaurant cater my 150 party indian-themed bridal shower - (restaurant sales went up 20% in the following 6 weeks because my guests loved their food) i was craving indian food and this place was close by the office so i thought to give it a try though a co-worker had a less than positive experience on her visit i had the lunch special #2 (chicken tikka and spinach puree with legumes) and ordered to-go the online menu states that soup is included in the lunch special but when i asked about it they said not for to-go orders that stipulation was not stated on their website the person who took my order seemed a tad bit confused and did not really understand what i was sayingwhen i went to pick up my food was waiting in a locker-type container and wasnt that hot i opened the styrofoam box to find half a piece of naan as a fan of indian cuisine i was most looking forward to this part of the meal the naan was thin and simply ok the portion was a bit small for $1000; only 3 pieces of chicken and about a table spoon of veggies the basmati rice lacked in flavor and disappointed as one of my favorite parts to indian cuisineall in all it satisfied my instant craving for indian food but would not go again due to the portion size and lack of flavor it was the epitome of the 2 star rating: meh ive experienced better the perfect chicken tikka masala i have had in a long time slight tinge of sweetness to the spiciness was heavenly with the garlic naan soooo my husband and i just relocated here to vegas from atlanta and we love it here just so happens that i had a taste for some indian food so i found this on yelp this is literally 5 minutes from my house the food was delicious i got the tandoori chicken vegetable samosas naan bread then i desired something a little sweet so for dessert i had the galub jamun (which were great just simply two small round balls drenched in rose syrup) this place has a very nice small intimate setting and everyone is nice cant wait to go back!!!i will try the chicken tikka masala!!!!!!,3.4545454545454546,22
Mayuri Palace,yum! mayuri palace was a godsend when we discovered it after a long and frustrating day shopping for cars exhausted cranky and feeling starved my family stumbled through the doors the restaurant felt clean and had a decent ambience with a nice large menu we were almost overwhelmed but went to some family favorites the veggie samosas were delicious but we were sad there were only 2 we really enjoyed the chicken tikka masala paneer tikka and lamb vindaloo all rich in flavor and cooked well! the garlic naan was perfect we ordered gulab jamun for dessert and found them a little disappointing 1/2 warm 1/2 cold like they had been quickly microwaved and with a simple syrup and no flavor like rose or cardamom while we were dining we saw another table redeem a groupon so we rushed on to see if they were available for purchase they were (what luck!) and we snapped up a $15 for $30 deal and used it on our meal we were in the process of eating! overall a great experience and would certainly go back if we were in the area again! used a groupon at mayuri palace and was very pleased! their butter naan was fantastic and their chicken tikka masala was great wasnt thrilled with our mayuri special chutney wala chicken and their decor is super weird otherwise great food and service we worked up a sweat at the nearby phoenix badminton center deer valley yesterday so after 3 1/2 hours of batting it around my pals and i decided to feed our faces at the mp indian buffet/restaurant againthe variety of veg/ non veg north& south indian cuisine is pretty nice and unusual the service was attentive as always and we settled right in after piling our plates highthe soups rice dishes appetizers bondas vadas samosas hot naan bread and tons of other delicious chicken tikka masala and fish called for several plates and bowls in attendance on our table desserts offer variety and drink the mango lassiyanow we contemplated either a nap back at the center (feasible in their comfy lounge) or to bat the birdie around and work off the lunch and decided on the latterthe mayuri palace is located blocks from the i-17 fwy/bell across from a fiat dealer and easy to get in and out from             bon appetit! i really hesitate to write this review since so many people absolutely love the food at this place so consider that when reading we came early on a friday night so it was pretty dead service was great and very friendly we ordered chicken tikka masala and garlic naan it came out hot and took about twenty minutes the sauce was thicker chunkier and less flavorful than i prefer we ordered one spicy which meant extra jalapeños - not sure if thats authentic? there was alot of chicken bones in the sauce as well which was unpleasant and we were constantly picking out pieces the naan was very good the price was spot on the dining room is not very nice (you are definitely going for the food and not the atmosphere here) and the glass tops on the tables had old food smudged on since we have a place we love closer to us we wouldnt return here final verdict - try it you may love the food! it sounds like the buffet might be the way to go we stopped at the mayuri palace for dinner  we ordered our favorite dishes   i was delighted that the lamb vindaloo i ordered was delivered as requested; very spicy   the flavor was not overwhelmed by the spicinesswe had a shrimp curry and chicken tikka masala as well all dishes were done very wellour sever was very warm and cheerfulwe will be returning to the mayuri palace for dinner and to try the lunch buffet we stopped in for lunch and to try out the buffetthe buffet had a good variety of curry dishes; goat fish butter chicken chicken tikka masalathe biryani was goodoverall i would call this a good lunch value,3.5,6
Mirch Masala,for those not aware this is the restaurant formerly known as taste of india - same location and phone numberi phoned in my order at 9:50 pm when they closed at 10 and they still took my order  my chicken tikka masala was great with great full taste and large chunks of chicken  my only qualm is that the portion size seems a little small for the price ill start by saying im no expert on indian food in fact i hadnt even had indian food i liked before coming here recently i went with a couple of other people and ordered the chicken vindaloo the chicken tikka masala chicken chilli spinach naan and cheese naan the cheese naan blew my mind i doubt thats even an authentic thing but wow is it amazing all of our entrees were seasoned perfectly as one of the people in my group made sure to order it indian spicy it wasnt heat but rather a blend of several spices that managed to stand apart from one another it was fabulous the portion size of the chicken tikka seemed a bit small for $13 but i actually ended up taking half of it home because it was so filling! im a fan,4.0,2
Southern Spice,we ordered a to go on tuesday evening spicy chicken veg biryani onion naan dal makhni chicken tikka-dry the food tastes really good ample size portions for 2 helpings ( for 2 people) the dal makhni was  yummy unfortunately the onion naan i had ordered seemed to have got burnt on one side wasa little charred but no complaints on the taste chicken dishes were good the southern spice chicken we rdered turned out more creamy than spicy( may go there againif next time we are in tempe pros-- neat little place tables well set staff courteous lunch buffet also available bar availablecons-- restaurant menu seems confusing while they claim to specialize in hyderabadi cuisine and southern india food why they still include north indian dishes beats me they should stay true to the name and concept also the menu has spelling and pricing mistakes curried shrimp becomes carried shrimp be careful while ordering breads breads and north indian veg entrees are al over the place not in one section the 2nd page lists aloo parantha under north specials riced at $799 on the second last page of the menu under breads parantha and onion naans etc ar priced between$199-299) seeing the huge $5 dollar difference for jst some potato filling on bread i changed my order from aloo  parantha to onion naan the bill however showed a charge of only $150 for aloo parantha i showed the staff why i had asked to change my order he sheepishly smile and said no aloo paranta is  what we charged on the bill       so the system has something the menu shows entirely different prices bar stool are good but seats are torn show wear and tear the restaurant has an open layout nd plenty of room     i recommend trying out the food at least once the foods good and the portions substantial but my 3 star rating is based on the price of the food yes i know indian cuisine is exotic and not as common as thai vietnamese chinese and sushi restos but for what they offer everythings pricey and above $10 that are only good to serve two people im not gonna say that im an indian food expert despite me living in the middle east when i was growing up where in muscat oman and in many gulf capitals and major cities indian food restos are so common that its equivalent to our overabundance of mexican restos here in phoenix we ordered our usuals the chicken tikka masala curry and the chicken korma with two garlic naans and rice wait a sec we had to order rice like that doesnt make sense its indian food so the bread or the rice should come with the entree like how weird would it be if i went to some mexican joint and ordered fajitas and had to also order the corn/flour tortillas?! anyways thats the basis of my 3 stars other than paying for small entree orders of curries and having to pay extra for rice everything else was fine next time i stop by im ordering out and cooking some rice at home this place was all right the was good and the portions were okay; it fed me and my friend but unfortunately it was not so awesome that i was able to overlook the price it was a bit pricey like over $10 a dish we got or usual the chicken tikka masala chicken korma naan and rice which wasnt even included in the price thats right people - rice was not included who does that?! rice is such a standard; i get ordering naan but rice? anyways other than that the place was all right the chicken tikka was yummy; the sauce had a nice consistency and was great with the naan :) we came here for dinnerbhindi masala - very good  great flavor and the okra was fresh  it was dry as it should be (but often is not at other indian restaurants)the lamb special - excellent  lamb was tender and the sauce was the perfect blend of heat and flavorchicken tikka masala - different less tomato-ey than other places ive been to  it was good but not what we were expectingchicken tandoori - the key here is that it wasnt dry  it was nice and juicythe garlic and butter naans were both perfectthe service was friendly and attentive  one of my favorite indian restaurants in the valley a pretty good buffet for $899 at lunch  the meat entrees were mainly chicken (chicken tikka masala chicken curry tandoori chicken chicken biriyani) with some vegetarian dishes (vegetable korma pakora curry daal)  they also included vegetable pakora idli and medu vada  i was pleasantly surprised to see the latter two  the idli had a nice texture and taste to go with the curries and the medu vada was nicely fried with a smooth slightly chewy texture  the sambar soup was very good- i got seconds on that!  there was also a basic salad bar and one dessert for our buffet today (carrot halwa very good not too sweet)  naan was served freshly made to our table (choice of plain or garlic) which had a light slightly crispy texture  it was also drizzled with butter just to gild the lily  i wasnt sure what to expect with this buffet based on the mixed reviews but based on my experience today i would definitely like to come here again for the buffet! being an indian  i always keep looking out for good authentic indian restaurants in the valley it was just by chance that i stumbled upon southern spice and have been in love with the food served here ever-since if you are looking for authentic south indian food  this is the place to be the kerala style biryani served here is just awesome i also tried the chicken tikka  which was really good  it was very juicy and perfectly cooked in the tandoor the garlic naan was also really good the only drawback about this place is :service is very slow i came to know of this restaurant through a groupon offer $40 value for $20 walked in my guest and i were greeted within a few seconds got to select our own table restaurant filled up pretty fast bollywood music videos played on the televisions by the bar restaurant was very clean ambiance was lovely good menus and great varieties on seating we were served papad accompanied with mint and tamarind chutnies the sauces were excellent! we ordered vegetable samosas mixed vegetable pakoras butter naan chicken tikka masala vegetable biryani accompanied with raita and curry sauce on the side and mango lassi (freshly made) the individuals attending to us were very pleasant and the pace of service was perfect soda filled in a timely manner us being asked how each course was shortly after they came out i was most pleasantly surprised overall i have had indian food all my life home-cooked restaurant-made; i am from india and have even at one time worked at an indian restaurant this was good food and it was a great experience shortly after our meal the owner stopped by and asked how everything was we talked for a few minutes i saw him do this at other tables as well that personal touch was important he told us his story of how he is from hyderabad (in andhra pradesh india) went to college near my hometown in india and now works in tempe while owning this fabulous restaurant another gentleman that had been serving us said he was from kerala in india (another southern state) and we chatted briefly as well i learnt they cater in a refreshing manner (breads and certain dishes are cooked in front of you at the venue) he shared with me about onam a kerala festival coming up late-august where they will be participating among other dining establishments and vendors to celebrate the occasion with great flair among those who enjoy delicious cuisines at an event partnered with asuthe prices are most reasonable and portions quite large i am eating leftovers at lunch while i write this review the day following and they heated up wonderfully!greatly looking forward to trying different items on the menu during my next visit! enjoy!! ive been here twice once for dinner i ordered chicken tikka masala and also a fried veggie/chickpea side dish the masala is okay; the chicken is a bit hardi went here for the lunch buffet none of the food was hot and they were serving meat it was covered but seemed to not be heated in any way i ate at noon and the buffet starts at 11am so i wasnt even at the tail end definitely some health concerns with thatif you go dont go to the lunch buffet indian spice previously known as taj mahal can not compete with any other indian restaurant in the valley i drafted a review for tandorii times about a year ago and was dead sure it was the best  but indian spice has me hooked i will definitely be back for the chicken tikka masala garlic naan samosas and the paneer- to die for if you like spicy- make sure you ask for way more than an 8 on the 1-10 scale our dishes were low medium at an 8,3.7777777777777777,9
India Oven,i shouldve known this meal was hopeless when our waiter brought my dining companion non-alcoholic beer instead of the real thing  thankfully he did not make this mistake with the wine however it still puzzles me as to why he brought the bottle to the table for inspection but did not think to also bring an implement for opening it the chicken tikka masala was almost passable but the assorted appetizers we ordered were pretty woeful a tiny little plate of dried up little bites almost indiscernible in flavor from one to the nextsuffice it to say india oven is not worth putting on your list of must dine at spots in las vegas! well just had dinner there an hour ago tried it because of a friends recommendation  i have to say it was just okay- a little more than what we wouldve spent if we had gone to india palacethe veggie samosa was very good spicier than most ive had the chicken tikka masala was good and the aloo matter ( they spelled it mutter) was alright too but the mixed tandoori was quite a disappointmentlittle pieces of chicken lamb and one prawn which they forgot to actually put on the plate and brought it out later! not to mention when i split my lamb it was still raw insidemehshouldve kept to our original plan and gone back to indian palaceoh well $88 bucks gone and we live and learn i dont understand the negative reviews we arrived later in the evening shortly before they were closing but the owner was gracious enough to  serve us the servers were very attentive i ordered the chicken tikka masala and it was delicious i also loved the mango lassi i particularly love hot spicy foods and their level of spice did not disappoint my girl loves her some indian food so she suggested (by waking me up) that we should go to india oven for lunch and then some java afterwards myself i am not too big on indian restaurants so far i have limited exposure to them and the few i have been to recently have not really been that great however being the open-minded boyfriend i am i gave it the good fight and went along with her ideait was lunch time and they has a small all you can eat buffet for i think it was $10 or $11 btw it took me a bit to catch on that when people on yelp were saying ayce they meant all you can eat yea i guess i can be slow sometimes and btw means by the way just in case grins~ ok back to the subject lol - laughs out loud ;pas i was saying the buffet was small and limited and ranged from dried up meat kebabs to nice tender chicken tikka masala a mutton stew along with the various vegetarian dishes like palak paneer (spinach and farmers cheese) sabji samosas (vegetable fritters) daal makhni (creamed lentils) and a few others so overall the buffet was home to maybe 12-15 items and their naan bread does rock my girl also ordered the sweet lassi homemade yogurt drink which she lovedit was slow so the waiter was always there when we needed a drink refill and was courteous when doing so our bill came to $31 and some change for the two of us which is not bad for a lunch out to try something different but i still have to say i have yet to try for myself an indian restaurant in las vegas that i could not wait to go back to eat there againthat said i am sure that many of you would enjoy the food especially the vegetarian assortment of dishes and my girl says the dinner menu is betterbest regardsjames culinary schmooze williams no one can beat there chicken tikka masala!! n there mango lassi is awesome! this place is so good fantastic naan samosas and buffet the service was excellent too we got an order of chicken tikka masala to go and the owner gave us a free order of naan to go with it highly recommended! wow another new buffet just popped up next door to hunan viii & across the street from new china!  better give it a try!    :-))india oven here is a nice mid-sized place with the open beam (open pipe?!) ceiling that is currently popular no windows (excellent for controlling the lighting!) & indian music playing at the right volume  my server started me off with a big goblet of good-tasting ice water which got me off to a good start here with it roasting hot outside!over at the serving area there were 19 food choices all together not counting sauces & thats a lot for an indian buffet  the salad was way above average with lots of goodies such as pickled carrot strings to add on plus a delicious dressingthe hot table is set up attractively with lots of good food to dig into such as goat curry chicken vindaloo chicken tikka masala chicken tandoori (of course!) & a number of good veggie dishes including a great one with chick peas in it that i should have gotten the name of but didnt  they had big plates available which is something i always appreciate  it says to me have all you want were glad youre here!a couple of things i liked a little less:*  it was marginally too dim in the place to read the magazine i brought along*  the space between the table & the booth seat was a little too great  i pulled it over but wouldnt have been able to if someone else had been along to sit on the other side*  the container of hot indian tea container had been allowed to run out so i didnt get any  (shouldnt have to ask)*  the proprietor lady brought me over just one slice of seasoned naan bread about the size of a slice of pizza  it was hot & tasty but there should have been more of it offered  (shouldnt have to ask)gripes aside the food was excellent here so it still gets a good strong 4-stars!lunch buffet $795  full bar coming soon we just came back from our first time at india oven but not the first time we have had indian food  we both got the buffet which came with delicious naan and tandoori chicken -- brought straight to our table from the kitchen  everything lived up to the other glowing reviews for this place on yelp  some small disappointments were that the naan was garlic -- we would have preferred plain to try for our first time out  also the mango lassi was a little warmer than i would have liked - but still was tasty!  and like the other yelpers have mentioned the spice level was low on the buffet  some of the things we really appreciated:  the place was clean service was very attentive the chicken tikka masala was very flavorful and we couldnt imagine it being better anywhere else!overall we really enjoyed our experience and will be back again! weve eaten here several times and have never gone wrong with any of the chicken or lamb dishes  i have not been able to bring myself to try any of the goat dishes yet but it is on my bucket listthis time around we had the madrasi lamb and chicken tikka marsala which were both deliciousthe chicken pakoras were a great start to the meal  although they do slightly resemble chicken nuggets they certainly do not taste processedwe always enjoy any of their bread selections  this time around it was garlic naan but again you cant really go wrong with any of themthe golab jamon dessert--homemade cheese balls made from cream of milk in a scented light syrup--is ridiculous  tastes like small puffs of pancake-y heavenit is super inexpensive with most dishes in the $10 rangethe service is the best ive ever had  everyone is so friendly and accommodating  the atmosphere is open and light  unfortunately it is always a really slow whenever we go  hopefully that only means that we come at the right time  everyone should be eating here i love it here! i only have gone here a couple of times for the buffet but i think thats the smart way to go!i had my first indian food experience here so i have nothing to really compare to i did have the buffet during lunch and dinner and there are only minor differences but the food is always delicious! i love how they bring hot garlic naan out to your table and refill it once its gone i love trying new food and the buffet help me do just that i get to taste a little bit of everything without having to waste food or burn a hole in my wallet now i know what i like [: the bf at the time loves their chicken tikka masala which i agree is absolutely amazing! but i also love their yogurt sauce and the mint chutney i seem to want to put those 2 sauces all over everything i eat oh and i love the basmati rice! its so different from all the rice i ever tried before but in a good way!the staff is real friendly and always refill your drinks and make sure you have everything you need all the time if you want indian food you should definitely come here! amazing delicious food and friendly service win win! i love this place the food is always fresh and they keep the naan coming this is where i go when i want to get my chicken tikka masala on!  try the carrot pudding for desert i know it sounds a bit weird at first but trust me this recommendation is coming from an avid indian food eater enjoy! i went here the other day with a friend after reading all of the glowing reviews but it was just ok! sad day the people who work here are very nice and friendly and the price really cant be beat but the food was not the best i have had around the valley we both got the buffet (of course) and it had high points and low points i thought the lamb (or goat?) was a little tough (usually its so tender from being cooked in the sauce all daynot really the case) and the same with the chicken the chicken tikka masala sauce was really tasty thoughgotta love that i also liked that the buffet comes with mango lassi and chai teadefinite plus i did not however like that they brought out the tandoori chicken to every table because i dont like tandori chicken and i felt really bad just leaving it there maybe they should ask first so they dont waste their food anyway the buffet is large and has a lot of variety but the flavor just isnt as good as some other buffetsmaybe ill give them another shot sometime in the future it could have just been the night i have now been to india oven at least 6 times all for the dinner buffet  each and every time the food has been fresh hot and extremely good it is hard to beat a dinner buffet that also includes fresh naan and tandoori chicken in fact my picky 5 year old can eat the chicken tikka every day and be extremely happythe only problem with putting up a good review here is that we like it being a hidden gemwe dont want to have to fight off the crowds! oh buffets why must you tempt me so? delicious food here at india oven and wonderful service! if you are looking for a wide array of authentic food this is the place to gowe came for a dinner buffet on a sunday evening it wasnt busy at all and for $10 a person we couldnt pass it up we were greeted warmly and seated quickly the restaurant has a lot of indian decor there is a tv on one of the walls and a full bar on the left side with authentic indian beersafter we got our first plate of buffet food and sat down we were brought a freshly made tandoori chicken! sizzling hot the chicken and beef were aromatic and tasty the garlic naan served at the table was fresh out of the oven steaming and had just the right amount of garlic flavoreverything on the buffet was wonderful we had to try a little bit of everything but were are sure glad we did the buffet was separated into non-vegetarian vegetarian and salad/dessert the meat section had lamb goat chicken tikka masala chicken curry and three different rices the vegetarian section had lentil soup aloo gobi (cauliflower with potatoes) two tofu dishes and a couple others i dont rememberthere was a salad bar with salsas dressings and watermelon (yum!) next to the salad bar were also vegetable samosas (warm crisp on the outside tender on the inside and terrifically spiced) and vegetable fritters the desserts included fried cheese balls with light syrup rice pudding and a small nut/almond based cookiethey also had a few drinks available on the edge of the buffet bottom line is you get way more than for bargained for especially for a $10 dinner service is top notch and we will definitely come again and pick some of our favorites i love this place i first visited for my birthday in 2011 never having experienced indian cuisine i was slightly worried about the amount of spices and heat but everything was great my favorites are chicken tikka masala lamb vindaloo tandoori chicken and the basil mint chicken curry the price is unbelievable with the varieties of food to choose from and the included garlic naan and tandoori chicken our last visit was 9/20/2013 and they had these delicious little coconut burfi pieces so good- you might not be a coconut fan but trust me these could change your mind quickly my husband and i both ate a countless amount if i lived closer i am sure i would visit at least weekly great food wonderful service excellent price! my new favorite indian buffet  the chicken tikka masala was the best ive had since working in silicon valley  the lamb vindaloo could have used more heat but the lamb was nice and tender  the saag paneer was the best ive ever had  tasted fresh and it had a little kick  thats a very welcome first  the garlic naan had the whole table raving  very good food and the price cant be beat although i have been craving some indian food for the greater part of the last year its taken me this long to get around to getting some the largest reason is the fact that i have two young kids who are rarely adventurous enough to try things outside of chicken fingers and mac and cheese once the indian bug had struck me one too many times hubby and i decided to leave it up to yelp on where we could score some sweet buffet actionreason being that the kids could pick and choose what they wantedweve passed india oven numerous times since its in the neighborhood but this was the first time going in when we arrived there was one other couple seated it was a little early for dinner so its understandable as soon and they left and it was just us in the restaurant the attentiveness of the servers was a little too much i do appreciate the endless basket of naan and the tandoori chicken thank you but i dont need to be asked if everything is okay every 5 minutes or so the staff was super friendly though so this was only mildly annoying once others arrived the attention shifted to them thank youthe chicken tikka masala was on pointi was very happy with that this was my first time trying lamb vindaloo and that was good too the paneer masala was good but the sauce was thinner than the chicken tikka i tried some other things all were decent the buffet is separated into vegetarian non-vegetarian and salad & dessert the vegetarian options were plentiful and the kids found a couple things they likedprice wise is where i knock the two stars off although the adult buffet is reasonable at $895 for dinner the kids buffet was $695 i knew what it was going into it but there is no way my five year old eats close to that amount she had some rice naan and some cheese ballsthats about it chances are if we come back it will be on a date night i really enjoyed this place! i had been here once before a while back with my mom but went back solo this time for the lunch buffetthey bring fresh garlic naan & sizzling tandoori chicken legs to your table the mango lassi (absolutely delicious & even a bit chilled to my surprise) is included at the buffet the vegetable samosas/pakoras are soooo tasty & crispy not soggy or greasy i always like to start with all the above & a bit of salad before digging into the curries and rice my choices for the curries were the chicken tikka masala which was great the palak paneer tastes really fresh the rice is really good & i loved the lentilsthe only thing i would change would be the lamb vindaloo its usually one of my favorites but it wasnt spicy enough & although the lamb was super tender its not really a vindaloo if it doesnt have a serious kick quick fix? the chili sauce by the salad & samosas can remedy this ;)i basically pigged out on lots of delicious food for $10 satisfied my craving for indian & read my book over my lunch hour in a nice quiet spot ill be back soon! :)-rageous everytime we visit arizona we go here! they always remember us too the chicken tikka masala is one of my favorites anywhere! love! a friend and i had lunch here today service was very attentive the buffett had a lot of options the saag paneer and chicken tikka masala was very good price was great for lunch i will be back again i had the dinner buffet its not bad for the money you pay the bill came to $14 and some change which included the two sodas i had i especially liked the chicken tikka masala and paneer tikka masala they also had some sort of rice pudding (i forget what it was called) in the dessert bar that was pretty good all in all the food was ok and certainly worth the money i paid but not nearly as hot and spicy as i expect (and like) my indian food to be i think that the spiciness of the buffet food is toned down a lot to make it more palatable to the tastes of most westerners maybe next time i will order something à la carte where presumably i can order the dish more hot and spicy to suit my tastes while visiting phx got a craving for indian and this place hit the spot  a lot of buffets i have been to will have chicken tikka masala but not as many places will serve up lamb vindaloo which is my favorite  i enjoyed both  the lamb vindaloo could have been spicier but i just asked for some hot sauce to turn up the heat  the garlic naan was great  a good selection  clean establishment  friendly and attentive service  great reasonable price thie best indian buffet in arizona both for lunch and dinner saturday is the best day for selection lamb vindaloo chicken tikka masala chili chicken chicken manchurian saag chana paneer kadhi pakora samosa pani poori garlic naan and tandoori chicken and more staff is very cool too,4.130434782608695,23
Khushi's,despite living in edinburgh for almost 4 years i hadnt made it to any of the infamous khushi restaurants so decided to pay a visit for my birthday night out i had a booking for 10 people for a two hour slot and was quite surprised at just how busy it was for a week night between christmas and new years the khushi reputation clearly drives a great trade having made an executive decision to dine from the christmas set menu (£1895 pp) minimising the agonies  of making a selection from the vast a-la carte and the squabbles over who had what when it came to paying the bill i was very impressed with the selection (and quantity) of the offering a pre-starter of pickles and popadoms kept us going while we waited for the last few of the party to arrive followed by a variety of starters including the typical chicken tikka onion bhajii and pakora the main course selection included a tender lamb jalfrezi tasty fish curry and chicken korma served with rice and naan there was something to cater for the taste of everyone it was a perfect way to try a selection of different dishesthe food was served buffet style and there was plenty to go around id be surprised if anyone could have managed dessert after such a feast coupled with the byob offering with no corkage charge the night was a successgreat value for money my only niggle would be the constant reminder from the waiting staff of the two hour booking slot not only to me but also to some of my guests which i felt added an unnecessary sense of urgency to the experience will definately visit again to dine from the a-la carte menu whenever i walk past this restaurant it is always packed i have always wondered why now i know :)it was a friday evening and my friend suggested we have dinner here we were offered a 630 booking and the restaurant was already full when i arrived a waiter asked if we wanted poppadoms to start with sure why not they were accompanied with 2 dips: mango chutney and a spicy onion dip (?) - real kick to iti had a mixed grill for my main course it is a mixed platter of chicken tikka prawn lamb chop and seekh kebab the chicken tikka was my favourite - i didnt know chicken can be so melt in the mouth stuff! the platter came with a simple chickpea salad and we shared a naan bread the service at times felt a bit rushed im not sure if this is because they really are so popular (eg a couple could not get a table as they had no reservation) and it was a friday howerver the food was nice khushis has a byob policy and no corkage charge which possibly is another factor to their popularity,3.5,2
Curry in the Box,how does this place only have 2 reviews?  the food and price is just too good for this place not to have some more hype  it was always empty whenever i went which was often  the chicken tikka masala is surprisingly good (given that it has a more thai focus) and spicy (you get to choose the spice level)  the green curry is also goodthe amount of food you get for the price is greatall take out comes with a large stuffed box of rice and a generous portion  one dish could probably fill two people or give one person delicious leftovers  only 4 stars because it never really wowed me  but you wont be disappointed my wife and i just moved nearby and this is the perfect place for takeout but weve eaten in both times weve gone the interior is much larger and nicer than expected from the outside weve now had jungle curry pineapple curry pad thai and chicken tikka all the dishes have been great the lunch menu is priced right ($550 instead of $850) without seeming too smallothers have mentioned that the staff is nice and we agree they also have a loyalty program that will give us discounts to a place wed be going to anyway which is ideal,4.0,2

Nandini Indian Cuisine,having recently turned vegetarian for health reasons i wondered if the paneer tikka masala could be half as good as their chicken tikka masala which was the best ive had from england to nyc to phx well no need to worry because it was superb! smooth and creamy the dish melts in your mouth there are numerous vegetarian options i strongly suggest samosas to start and you cant go wrong with their saag/palak chana masala either of the dahls the yummy okra dish or the aloo gobi with savory cauliflower and potatoes add rice and garlic naan and you will have a delicious  meal take some home too cuz its even better the next day!  friendly and courteous staff and the owner usually stops by every table for about $7 this buffet is a great deal mango nectar and hot chai tea are included with the buffet a nice touch and garlic naan is made freshly right to your table the buffet itself consisted of a mix of various popular vegetarian and chicken based dishes such items included paneer tikka masala chicken tikka masala aloo tikki chicken vindaloo aloo gobi and saag theres a salad bar with various dressings and a selection of carrot halwa gulab jamun and kheer/rice pudding for dessert my favorite dish out of the buffet items was the aloo gobi it had a great mix of flavor and had large chunks of potato and cauliflower the tikka masala dishes i tried were very heavy on the cream and had a mild flavor the chicken vindaloo normally a very spicy dish was probably about a medium level of spiceservice was good dishes were taken away promptly and water was refilled as neededwhile other buffets might have more selection and better preparation nandini pares down the items to cut down on cost and includes beverages to add more value for your dollar we were really sad to see royal taj close down like seriously i almost went in to a depression :(so when we heard nandinis was open we were super excited to go try! the restaurant looks brighter and spruced up and to our delightful surprise the food was even better than before! four a party of 4 we ordered the:lamb korma (lamb cooked in special house gravy) $1399  chicken tikka masala (boneless chicken pieces grilled in tandoor cooked in a mild creamy tomato gravy) $1199 palak paneer (tender chunks of indian cottage cheese cooked in a spinach sauce) $899 with:garlic naan (white leavened garlic sprinkled bread baked in clay oven) $249lamb naan (white leavened bread stuffed with minced roasted lamb baked in clay oven) $399and ricei put $$ because they offer a cheaper lunch buffet $ which we have yet to try dinner is more in the range of $$  at the end they brought over some complimentary gulab jamun (succulent treats from the north made of special dough fried and served in sugary syrup)! delicious :)i would recommend these three entrée items for sure! if you are a vegetarian the palak paneer is a must - soooo delicious its creamy spinach and the cheese is super fresh tasting they go great together! but the lamb korma has to be the winner - with chichken tikka masala as a close second for something new we tried the lamb naan which was like an indian version of a quesadilla with lamb pieces in between their delicious naan bread cant wait to try more new items on the menu :) this one was great! for any newbies this place is a must! the new owner seemed very friendly and accommodating the restaurant decor is so-so but i havent found indian food this good anywhere else in az were soooooooo happy theyre back!,4.666666666666667,3
Indian Paradise,i always love being pleasantly surprised i love driving to scottsdale airpark for indian food expecting nothing special (as to not get my hopes up) and being very pleasantly surprised mr hottie was coming into town and i had erin and ayesha rounded up for dinner at another venue well mr hottie throws me a curve ball by texting me during a layover to state im craving indian food i think to myself keep cool chica sure you can find a good spot on last minutes notice! so i hop on yelp and try to find a good indian joint that is not located in the east valley yay! indian palace pops up on my search suh-weet! so i alert my girls of the venue change and off we go! when we arrived at the strip mall location and walked in i noticed how big the place was! it reminded me of a big warehouse that was converted into a restaurant i was also hit with the smell of spices and gravies which was actually impressive because this was on the eve of the complete loss of my sense of smell and taste due to a terrible cold the menu for dinner was quite large i chose the chicken tikka masala (my fave) while my dinner partners chose a few other dishes everything was delicious and made to order i ordered my masala medium while ayesha ordered hers spicy and it seemed to come out as ordered the one draw back that i had with this place is that they charge for rice to go with your meal but we soon got over it and enjoyed our wonderful meal! i returned with ayesha on a sunday to try their lunch buffet it was very good and large! for about 12 bucks you had a choice of about 10-15 dishes rice naan and a drink (champagne was an option for sunday) on that day there was a very large birthday party being seated and i think they sat about 30-40 people with more revelers coming in the door so the restaurant is no small cafe for sure! indian paradise is the place to go if you dont want to drive to arizonas silicon valley (chandler/ahwatukee area) their food is flavorful and delicious i look forward to trying them again very soon! we just moved to phoenix from colorado in boulder there are tons of indian food and nepali places to choose from and my family is also nepali so when it comes to that style of food i know what i am looking forso when my husband and i were in the mood for some home-cooked food (we dont have a kitchen yet) we yelped up the best restaurant and drove about 45 minutes to get there when we got to indian paradise it was just after 5 so we were the first ones in there we ordered daal chicken tikka masala chicken curry garlic naan and vegetable samosas  we are always wary of trying new places for indian cuisine because we are soo often disappointed but this restaurant was a very pleasant surprise it was really very delicious some of the best chicken tikka i have ever had i ordered mine at medium spice but i probably could have had it more spicy i also tried the chicken curry that the hubby ordered and it was very delicious!! we were very very pleased with the food over-all and will most definitely go back even though it was more expensivethe staff was also very nice we told (im assuming) the owner that we were new and we found this place on yelp and he was very happy about that we asked of some places to go with some hindu culture and he graciously gave us some ideas he also gave us his card and told us to call if we needed help finding anything culture based the only down side was that i did get some dirty looks from a woman who pulled up in a yellow corvette im assuming she just is not very well cultured we eat indian food with our hands because that is how it is meant to be eaten i swear it tastes better that way! ask anyone from india or nepal and i guarantee you they do eat with their hands and will show you the technique so when we had been craving some home cooked food i decided i was going to eat it how it tasted best the dirty looks were well worth it though because the food was soooooo good completely satisfying i am very very glad that we made the drive up there (we live all the way at baseline and central) the left-overs the next day were awesome! we will definitely be back ive had chicken tikka masala at different places around the country this time it had a different wonderful flavor the rice was perfect garlic naan hot crisp and chewy i tried the mango dessert like ice cream everything was delicious service was polite and very attentive i didnt think you could find great indian food in scottsdale we were recently in scottsdale on a house hunting trip and like others we yelped to find a great restaurant we were not disappointed with indian paradise as we pulled up in front of this quaint restaurant in the strip shopping center near the airport we could smell the delightful aromas the restaurant is casual (we were in shorts and a jeans skirt and were fine) the restaurant was clean and service was polite and attentive without being overwhelming we ordered samosa to start which were fantastic the samosas were well seasoned and not at all greasy yum! we followed the samosas with chicken tikka masala (the yard stick by which we judge all indian restaurants) and the bhindi-go-pizaz ( a vegetarian okra dish) the food was outstanding we ordered the meals medium and found them to be well seasoned and not at all hot if you like something more spicy i would suggest you order it hot the staff was quick to refill soft drinks at no charge and without prompting overall it was a great experience - we will definitely go back hurray! indian food found! having lived in boston for a year where you cant help but dine on indian food frequently i was quite hopeful to fill that void when i moved to phoenix yelp came to the rescue!i went around noon for the buffet and was immediately greeted with the delicious smells wafting outside the restaurant once inside we were quickly shown a table and drink orders taken but onward to the food! there were probably 10-12 main items available; i was happy to see about half of which were vegetarian selections (yay for veggie korma!) the food was actually well spiced for being at a buffet actually it was probably the best seasoned indian ive ever had! im not one for spicy as hell food but come on how many bland indian buffets have i had? (dont ask) the vegetables were cooked perfectly - not too mushy - and the chicken tikka masala i tried from my partners plate was quite tenderthe staff was polite and attentive; drinks refilled and used plates taken away promptly the establishment appeared clean charming and was quite busy with other dinersoh i will be back oh yes oh yes came in during lunch for the buffet i was expecting the standard buffet items (which they had) but i also saw a few things that are not always a fan of chicken tikka masala they also had a paneer version yum! they had some really good seasoned roasted jalapenos that made a great addition to the plate added nice heat and flavor to the dishes in addition to the naan on the table they also offered puri at the buffet this was a nice option the desert was different it was white and had a distinct rosewater flavor to the syrup  i am used to the softer donut hole type gulab jamun in a cardamon honey syrup  this i have come to find out was rasgullai definite enjoyed the variety and the quality of the food not enough for 4 stars but i would go back if in the area and craving indian cuisine when i am in the mood for some truly comforting food i head to indian paradise for some chicken tikka masala and thats exactly what i did this past weekend  for about 4 years my husband and i have been frequenting this establishment and after our most recent visit this past weekend i feel compelled to write a reviewfirst of all as other people have said the prices here are high and possibly not 100% worth the portion size however i still go back time and time again and ill tell you why the food and service  we always get the chicken tikka masala and it is true comfort in a bowl  that sauce combined with some garlic naan can cure any issue you may be having in your life well for at least a little while maybe  the papadum and chutney that they give you before the mean is great  weve had the samosas which are fried goodness and very flavorful  lastly this past time we had the tandoori shrimp which was surprisingly awesome the veggies were cooked perfectly and the shrimp was seasoned well and the lemon was a nice touchif you havent had indian food you must try it and if you havent gone to indian paradise please do  we pay the high prices because we dont want to see this gem disappear like so many other restaurants  this mom and pop shop has stayed in business due to their great tentative service and excellent food so go! i love their food everything ive had there has been delicious!the chicken tikka chicken curry and coconut curry shrimp are really good! i had an enjoyable lunch here with rand h and mike c the other day  indian paradise has a very nice lunch buffet with a variety of authentic indian cuisine items   to choose from   restaurant~ very clean and inviting  its not a large restaurant but it has plenty of room for multiple groups the service is ok not bad but not great either   food~ we started with some soup and salad  they had one soup tomato soup on the day we went  it was ok and so was the salad they bring fresh pita bread to your table  some with garlic and herbs which was very nice  they had several dishes to choose some with curry and without  the chicken curry was very good and so was their paneers  i was looking forward to the tandoori chicken and their chicken tikka marsala but the chicken had a sparse odor of benzene so it was not tasty they also had roasted jalapenos with black salt which i think is an acquired taste ~ not for me  all in all some of their food tasted very good and some not so good most everything is a bit mushy so you will need to start at the rice cooker or get a bunch of bowls  this is a very good place to try some indian cuisine if youre in the area this place is a vast distance from my house fortunately i was in the area on business met the wife and went here for lunch based on the positive yelp reviews and the fact that shed been here before and really liked it god im glad i did the first thing that hit me was the smell as we walked in - amazing ive been to a lot of indian buffets; this one smelled the best so far so good found our table but as usual with any given buffet arse didnt hit the chair before i was schlopping food onto my plate dhal channa chicken curry aloo gobhi chicken tikka masala (out when i was at the buffet but they filled it up pretty quick after) meat and pea samosas potato pakoras and a giant laundry-basket-sized rice cooker to scoop from flung a few ribbons of raita jackson pollock-like (or ron jeremy-like depending on your aesthetic sensibilities) across the heaped plate and back to the table to dine out came some garlic naan (better than regular naan!) which was thin and fresh making good on the promise of the initial smell the food was very flavorful best buffet ive been to the chicken curry was actually spicy not dumbed down why the hell does this place have to be ~40 miles from my house? one things for sure ill be back maybe not for a while but still - indian paradise rocketed to #1 on my indian restaurant list after the first mouthful and im pretty sure the same will be the case for any indian food aficionado that tries it word of warning - it may be too much of a punch in the mouth for newcomers to the cuisine - if thats you i suggest getting your feet wet at bombay spice (tatum and shea) first before trying this joint came out with my gut looking like an alien was going to bust out of it and my tastebuds feeling as though theyd gone around the lhc a few billion times hands down five out of five the interior is clean and decorated well went here for the lunch buffett; for $1195 you get a good selection of food: chicken tikka masala chicken curry samosas chicken tandoori aloo gobhi and some others i missed all of them tasted good for a buffett and they made a conscious effort to refill the food quickly i also got garlic naan with my order and i highly recommend it: it was very crispy and didnt have too much garlic on it for desert i had the gulab jamun with rice pudding which was also very good my only complaint was the rice: it was kinda hard and thin im not sure if they intend to cook it this way but i prefer my rice kinda sticky service was pretty good as well they took away the buffett plates in a timely manner and refills were prompt i got tired of going to the chain restaurants so if youre in scottsdale i would recommend this place for a nice change of pace indian paradise has a solid lunch buffet at $1195 maybe a little more expensive than usual for a buffet but its in north scottsdale so not completely unexpected either nice interior and even looks like the patio could be a pleasant dining experience when theres nice weather surprising considering that the restaurant is located in a fairly bland out of the way strip mallthe food was very tasty and will certainly sate your desire for indian comparatively it was middle of the road as far as the indian food ive had--not the best but not the worst but if you love indian food like i do you wont be disappointed the lunch buffet has a lot of the standard dishes: chicken tikka masala chicken curry aloo matter palak paneer tandoori chicken etc tikka masala is usually my favorite but theirs was just ok i really liked their chicken curry and aloo matarservice was good; everyone was friendly and attentivealso dont panic when you dont see the naan at the buffet like i did they bring you your own basket :) 7/25/12heard great things about indian paradise from good yelp friends and i thought it was about time i scratched this itch i had for indian cuisine for many weeks  ive passed ip many times before noting it was on hayden rd but never really memorized its location  disregard the directions from navigation android app and follow yelp directions instead  $1095 gets you all-you-can-eat lunch buffet with fresh garlic naan and a glass of water  all other beverages will cost extra  i ordered a mango lassi for $4  buffet selections werent many but i managed to gather a varied plate http://wwwyelpcom/biz_photos/lffye-hh1nkftukv3lugfg?select=d7h3jj4h89ifrify0ia-7w#d7h3jj4h89ifrify0ia-7w that consisted of (clockwise starting with) tandoori chicken palak paneer chicken tikka masala dal tadka (yellow lentils) dal makhni (red lentils) chicken curry  paneer tikka masala (curd cheese in masala sauce) some shredded lettuce for texture (not pictured) mango and tamarind chutneys and finally gulab jamun for dessert  http://wwwyelpcom/biz_photos/lffye-hh1nkftukv3lugfg?select=szjnbzvd9lxjadhg9dmh7g#szjnbzvd9lxjadhg9dmh7g  the mango lassi was gorgeous and better yet it tasted fantastic!  before i had a taste of it a man who was passing by my table on his way out of the door stopped to ask what it was  i guess he liked the look of it as well  i wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who loves mango lassis-- great mango flavor a touch of sweetness and a definite yogurt tang  the naan took a long time to arrive even after i sat down asked for a lassi first had a look at the buffet choices and then proceeded to gather my plate and utensils before lining up to get food  i had to wait another five minutes maybe more before it arrived on my table which then allowed me to take a good photo to upload and then start eating  the naan was warm some parts were crispy some parts were charred and not very flavorful  i couldnt detect a garlic flavor at all  the dals were ok the red saltier than the yellow so i preferred the yellow  i found the palak paneer to be tastier than the paneer tikka masala which was salty yet i found the paneer tikka masalas curd cheese cubes to be more tender therefore more preferable; the cheese cubes in the palak paneer were rubbery  the chicken curry was very appetizing!  loved sopping up the sauce with the naan  perhaps the blandness of the naan was intentional to make it a great companion to the sauces  the tandoori chicken was very very good and perhaps the best ive tried anywhere  great smoke flavor tender and moist-- i wouldnt mind ordering this for an entree  i was already finished with lunch and wanted dessert (gulab jamun rice pudding or watermelon slices) when i spotted the chutneys but i had some naan left so i thought to try them out  the mango chutney looked wonderful and made me wish i had pancakes or crispy waffles to eat it with  before trying it with naan i spooned a little bit into my mouth and found it to be quite salty so it wouldnt do well for a sweet snack unless you like sweet and salty (and i do on occasion but not in mango chutneys)  the tamarind chutney more syrup than chunky chutney really was definitely sweeter  the gulab jamun rounds were tougher than others ive tried; i kept wishing the centers were creamier/silkier  i liked the sweet milk flavor although the syrup wasnt scented with rosewater or saffron  id say pass on these last three and save your calories for a lassi! i would give them 35we got there for early dinner thinking they had buffet but they did not hubby had been fasting so we didnt want to look for other options and wait longer we stayed and ordered from the menu chicken tikka masala (it comes with rice not all white but i do not know what it has i checked online and it could be cumin seeds) and we also ordered naankudos to our server (a young lady) that volunteered some information about chicken tikka being served with no sauce (i got confused and ordered chicken tikka instead of chicken tikka masala) so thanks to her timely intervention i got what i meant to order and not what i had mistakenly ordered if that makes any sense : p*we forgot to ask for our food to be hot/spicy : (we had only water to drink and overall everything was good i was a little disappointed with the sauce on the chicken but that could be because this place is from a different area in india or somethinggarlic naan was really good also the place itself is very nice they have booths and it is nicely decorated the place is more inviting than the ip 2i just would like to mention that i am sensitive to scents and our server was wearing a perfume a little too strong if you ask mei would like to go back to try the buffet not bad not greatthey have a lunch box special but wont allow you to eat on the premises each time ive gone in theyve never offered to seat me (i go alone)  ive had to ask about the lunch special all three times and have not really been told much else other than ok  left in the entryway with no offer of a seat or any indication of where to pay or if i can sit down while i wait they bring the food but no one seems to know if ive paid or not - communication among staff isnt exactly stellarthe lunch box ive had 3 times has been chicken tikka masala (despite what the menu says the lunch box of the day is)the rice is really good the chicken tikka masala is decent but seemed to be more sauce than chickenthe naan bread (garlic) is kickassjust okay although ill probably go back for the naan alonethey do a lunch buffet but i have never been offered a seat so havent tried it food was decent but nothing to write home about this used to be the best indian restaurant in the valley sadly thats not the case anymoregot chicken vindaloo and chana masala chicken vindaloo isnt supposed to be tomato-based but here it was tasted like a slightly altered version of chicken tikka masala chana masala was average as well excellent! we tried it based on the nearby yelp search and such a treat! this is our new favorite indian spot great service 3 different waiters taking care of the dining room very prompt to bring crispy naan and sauces when we arrived we started with the crispy potato cakes - pakoras - and raita delicious then things got even better chicken tikka masala and vegetable vindaloo with garlic naan everything was amazing we had 4 different sauces to dip in and the flavors were great we like super spicy so we requested their hot sauce and it did not disappoint if you like great indian look no further! let me start by saying im not a huge fan of indian food -- however; i do like the food here the atmosphere is elegant and quiet and the menu has a great variety to it there are also indian music videos playing in the background with beautiful men and women wearing every color known to man the chicken tikka masala was delish and i could live off of the garlic naan for a few days at least this is one of the best indian restaurants ive been to in phoenix! we got samosas to start; for entrees we had chicken tikka tandoori chicken korma lamb kofta curry and plain naan everything was pretty delicious! the chicken korma was better than i think ive ever had and i really enjoyed the chicken tikka tandoori! the naan was wonderful also! the samosa wasnt the best one ive had but it was still good and big portions! we also had one of the specialty cocktails with mango lassi yum! lastly the staff was friendly and quick! i would highly recommend! we have been to many indian restaurants over the year but this place is a top contender!  you can tell that they use very quality ingredients and know how to cook chicken tikka masala and rogan josh to a perfection we surely recommend! never going back the food was really blend went with a colleague for lunch buffet every indian place i have ever been to at least had good chicken tikka masala but it was just too bad here paneer was equally tasteless the place was surprisingly full probably due to lots of it companies near by we went there for fathers day dinner the chicken tikka masala was good but the chefs tandoori special for $2195 was terrible! it was like a very horrible fajita with all their lunch meat left overs the meat was tough and bad tasting not tandoori style at allthe sikh kabab was more like sausage texture we thought to get the best for my poor husbands fathers day but he ended up with the most expensive food on the menu that was also the worst on the menu  the rice also was all broken up and oldsince we were starving and was fathers day we did not complain i will make sure never again go for dinner there dinner is too expensive and not  goodthe buffet should be ok i will give it one more try but on their buffet it seems they take buffet left overs and serve it a la cart at dinner time and charge three times more if you are coming for atmosphere then move along when we visited on a saturday night a few weeks back we were the only diners eating in the restaurant for the 1st 30 mins of our meal! but frankly who cares i am a nut for chicken tikka masala and this place does the best in the valley period the naan bread was maybe a little too dry but what did i care when i was dipping it in such deliciousness!i wont go anywhere else for indian food now,3.782608695652174,23
Indian Maharaja Palace,i continued my recent indian food fixation today by revisiting an old haunt during the few years i spent living in the west valley our favorite indian restaurant was maharaja palace back then i would have given it four or five stars however with so many new great places opening in tempe chandler and the surrounding area i can only muster three in comparisonthe place has never been much to look at so i cant really fault it there it is in a really old strip mall and the interior reflects that however what i dont remember from before was the lack of choices they only had about four or five main dish choices--a fraction of what the newer places are offering the food was not as good as i remember either for example ive had some supremely awesome tandoori chicken lately and maharaja palace was average at best compared to those; same with their chicken tikka masala--good but not memorable service was decent as always no complaints there price for the lunch buffet was $895i dont get out west very often these days so i cannot compare with what other restaurants are doing in the area but to me this was a disappointing visit i want to mention that this place continues to appear in various best of lists--arizona republics for example so your mileage may vary ive been craving indian food since i moved from boston to phoenix two months ago and tonight i finally caved  i got medium-spice chicken tikka masala from maharaja palace  i will not be returning to this place (unless the other local indian joints are even more disappointing)  the food was totally adequate and the medium spice is fairly spicy which i like but the dish just lacked the richness i grew to expect in boston  thats not the real reason for my 2-star rating though  chicken tikka masala plus rice--which they charge extra for--came to $1642  im giving the low rating because this is not good value for money  i love indian food--i really do--but lets acknowledge for a moment that a lot of indian food--or at least this dish--is basically slop  slop that should be absolutely delicious  this wasnt absolutely delicious and it was expensive--and all the more so because of the slop factor,2.5,2
Gandhi India's Cuisine,having just got off the plane from la and having not eaten for several hours i was on the verge of passing out  (not really but i was feeling pretty peckish)jeff and i were driving towards the hotel when i spotted gandhi out of the corner of my eye  knowing that he likes india having lived there for over a year i thought he might like to try  i am always willing to try a new indian place  i got a combination plate that had chicken tikka some marinated chicken kafta chopped up and a grilled shrimp  the plate also came with some lentils rice raita lettucepaneer in a curry sauce and a curry with shrimp in it  jeff got a vegetarian plate that had the same rice raita and lentils but he also got a cauliflower dish (i dont remember the name) and some other curried vegetable  he ate it all so i know he liked it but i dont think he loved it  i loved pretty much everything i got except the lentils they needed something  salt?  the paneer was delicious  it reminded me of the fresh cheese my grandmother used to make  the shrimp curry was delicious just the right amount of heat to it  the raita was tasty  the rice was nothing speciali liked the naan  i ate several pieces and i dont normally do that  jeff ordered a mango lassi  he asked that they make it special with no milk just yogurt  they did that and he loved it  he might have ordered another if he werent so full  the service started off really well but then it went downhill from there  we got the food and then we never saw the waiters again they were busy serving others  so we waited forever for the bill and a box to take home the leftovers  the decor was kinda nice kinda funky kinda dark and kinda fashionable  i liked certain parts of the restaurant like the giant wooden ganesh near the entrance  the red on the walls was nice  the paintings werent anything special  they turned up the lights for us so we could read the menu there were some special rooms that could be shut off with curtains  i liked that touch i would definitely go back  i wonder what the buffet would have been like since we were there for dinner the restaurant is very simple and plain on the outside  once you enter the decor is simple yet nice  the atmosphere and music is upbeat  service was good and the food here is good but nothing compared to baluchis in new york  i was there with a group and we ordered mango lassi a variety of naan chicken vindaloo chicken tikka masala chicken biryani and more  the place is worth a try if you are out in vegas and are willing to explore outside of the strip wow such an upgrade since i used to spend countless lunch buffets with coworkers back in the day when i used to work in the howard hughs pkway offices i took my wife there for lunch just last weekthe grub:- chutneys and sauces galore- plenty of your veggie favorites: stewed chick peas saag paneer (spinach with cheese) curry potatoes and peas fried onion dumplings and other dishes - all delicious- meat too - tandori grilled chicken chicken tikka butter chicken etc- got bread and carbs? basatmi rice naan rice cakes spicy noodle dish samosas all good- dessert: mango custard with fruit fried brown sugar pastries in a sugary syrup sauce and fresh fruit - yummy- hot tea coffee mango lassi sodas and juices availablethe joint:- such a turn around from when i used to frequent years back the white table clothes have been replaced by all wood tables covered by fancy black linens the open balcony now houses private dining areas perfect for parties that want an intimate booth even the buffet section is granite counter tops with built in buffets - fancy much fancier than the old tables with the buffet heat trays- indian decor - many intricate paintings and woodwork abound including a huge wooden hand carved goddess at the entry floor to ceiling curtains and fabrics of india surround you very nice- plenty of seating- clean and upscale (especially for a buffet)the squeeze:- friendly and attentive service as always- about $25 per person for lunch - a little pricey- cash and card acceptedthe final say:my wife and i enjoyed our lunch buffet and it kept us full for most of the day and for me it was such a pleasant surprise to see that the owner has done so much to upgrade on such a great indain buffet restaurant despite being located in a seedy strip mall a friend and i had previously tried this place for dinner and it was decent 3-star territory however a recent visit to try their lunch buffet was a different story the first thing that stuck out was the cheap plastic plates disposable plastic eating utensils and styrofoam/plastic cups for water and soups/sauces i have been to many indian lunch buffets but this was the first time ive seen such cheap dining ware being used while they had several vegetarian offerings they only had a couple of mediocre meat dishes: chicken tikka masala and tandoori chicken there was a huge tray of naan which looked overly doughy and dried out so i didnt even bother trying it the subpar mango pudding was too watery and contained cheap canned fruit the halwa dessert was extremely dry and just gross my friend and i commented that the only thing at the buffet that they seemed to do pretty well was the basmati ricewhen the bill came i was in for another shock $1295 for an indian lunch buffet?!? that has got to make this the priciest one in town since most are in the range of $999 to $1099 now if this buffet was one of the best i probably wouldnt mind paying a premium price come to think of it if they lowered the price to $895 it still wouldnt be worth it there are just too many better places in town ie taj palace or mt everest to waste your appetite on this one looking for good indian restaurant in las vegas for years we finally found the one everything about gandhi is good (maybe location is a little farther than i would like) decor: rich dark colors very spacious roomsfood: excellent!papadom (compliments of the chef) light crispy not overly spicyfor starters we ordered paneer pakora very good seasoned excellent appetizermulligantawny soup be prepared to unusual preparation not what  you would expect but very goodentries:chicken tikka masala omg!! best tikka masala i ever hadfish korma this dish is not on a menu but i asked if it would be possible to prepare it for usthats another big star to gandhi restaurant every our request was  accommodated they try to make your dinner a real experience which gives a great feeling of being taken care of  back to entries eggplant bharta we asked to make it mild well you can not really make this dish mild it is meant to be spicybut hey managed funny mild on a beginning it gives you a kick  a couple of sends later we actually asked to make another one like it so we can take it home!naan excellent another item we ordered more for take out we enjoyed laterprices:surprisingly inexpensive the portions are quite big we ordered mango lassie which was twice the size of any lassie we had before price however was $350? i almost was ready to say to our waiter that this is to cheap and they should raise the price (but of course i  did not say anything)overall great restaurant if you get a chance stop here and you wont regret it this place has thalis with different names like bengali thali south indian thali etc thali with names from every part of india but each thali has more or less the same food punjabi food like chicken tikka nan and dal i had ordered south indian thali and thought he had got the wrong order when i told him about it he told me i should have read the menu more carefully he told me no matter what the name it only has punjabi food i felt cheated by them and left they did charge me about $25 for that fake thali [review is for the lunch buffet]not the best buffet in vegas and not the cheapest (running about $1295) but you can expect some good spice from the buffet optionswhat sets gandhi india cuisines buffet aside from other indian buffets in vegas is the surprising spice  the general tendency in an indian buffet is to keep it bland  the buffet has to make a lot of different palates happy and the general tendency is to keep it bland to make the most folks happy  but cheers to gandhi for not skimping on the spice  they usually have several vegetarian options in the buffet and a number of delicious chicken dishes  theres some real hit and miss going on with the dishes  i loved the paneer in spicy butter cream and the chicken tikka masala  and thumbs up for the naan and the okra dish  that said many of the dishes simply fall flat  problem is at $1295 this is one of the more expensive non-strip buffets and it is simply just not spectactular i had a great experience when i ate here a few days ago i started with the tandoori mix grill this plate had a nice mix of chicken lamb and prawns it all tasted great for the main course we had the chicken tikka and the prawn curry both these dishes had just the right amount of spices and filled with taste  if you have never tried indian cuisine make sure this is the 1st indian restaurant you try the food will not disappoint had this place last night and it was very good  ordered the tandoori mixed grill chicken tikka masala & paneer kadhai and all three dishes were hot and flavorful  the service was a bit slow and since there were only few other tables being used thought it wouldve been better maybe they were a little short on staff since it was a tuesday night  wouldve given 5 stars if the service more on the spot,3.2222222222222223,9
Shezan Indian Cuisine,having only been to this restaurant once before years and years ago i think it was well worth another visitwith khushis having opened up just down the road they have revamped the interior which i think definitely encouraged us to go and give it a try i wasnt sure what to expect but i really was surprised and will most definitely be backwe had the poppadoms as an appetiser  - which came with a really good selection of different sauces - not just the usual mango chutneyi had the mixed kebab starter which was really good - especially the spicy mini lamb chops i wasnt so sure on the shish kebab but my dad loved it! the chicken tikka bites were deliciousi had a special chicken bhuna with steamed rice - which was a nice change to the usual basmati the portions were good sizes and for once i didnt feel too full after the main which was idealtheir selection of movenpick ice creams was great - try the mint choc chip one! they also had a selection of indian desserts alsothe bar list was not extensive but just what you needed and pretty reasonableit was quiet although it was a monday night but a fair few folk came in around 10ish after the playhouse opened its doors shame some of the people sitting next to us were very ignorant do you do prawns? my friend doesnt like rice! oh deari would definitely recommend just a shame the staff have to put up with some really awful people! for those of you who have yet to experience it let me just say that there is something so comforting about seeing a people love us on yelp sticker in the window of a popular restaurant in another country when youve been wondering around without access to the app and are almost too tired and hungry to care where you actually eatwith that said thank you edinburgh yelpers for this treasure  after a full day of walking and touristing after a full week of pub grub we were ready for something different  id tried to find an indian place recommended by the guide book from memory and failed  so we headed back towards our guest house remembering several busy indian places on leith walk  shezan drew us in with the bright and modern decor self-described in the menu as bollywood  we were seated immediately and eagerly perused the menu trying to figure out which dishes were the cause of all the tantalizing smells from those around uswe decided on samosas chicken tikka masala chicken karahi a side of saag rice and naan  the samosas (3 with a selection of 3 sauces) were crispy on the outside with fluffy and flavorful fillings  the mains were amazing particularly the karahi  the karahi had so much flavor but without filling heavy  it was plenty spicy in a way that had just enough heat to wake you up but not so much to cover the other flavors or make you reach for something to cool off your tongue  the naan was huge - the size of my head  perhaps im just accustomed to other restaurants that cut it into peices rather than presenting it in on big piece but ive never seen naan this large  it was crispy on the bottom and fluffy on top deliciousthe food definitely deserves 5 stars  the service not so much  it started off well but even when wed cleaned our plates (and yes there were no morsels not even of sauce left) and there was nothing left in our glasses it took several minutes to get the attention of any staff to ask for the check  its probably us not being accustomed to the european way of lingering at a table all night but still felt like wed been forgottenthat aside id still highly recommend it,4.0,2
Shamoli Thai & Indian Cuisine,was walking up the royal mile and saw their sign for thai and indian buffet who could resist?im used to buffets in the us which are rows upon rows of food  this buffet featured maybe eight chaffing dishes decent food way too many fried selections for my taste  the chicken tikka masala was sweet which surprised me beyond that i cant say that anything struck me as particularly great or bad  a decent meal especially if youre looking for something other than british food,3.0,1
Saffron Flavors of India,this is the best indian food ive had in las vegas to date im so glad i found this place so close to home my gf usually doesnt like indian cuisine but this place was an exception order was: chicken tikka boti garlic naan cheese naan chicken korma lamb kabob tandoori chicken wings the chicken tikka boti was my gfs favorite out of all these dishes mine was the chicken korma at level 5 spiciness makes my mouth water just thinking about that creamy goodness the naan was perfect on both accounts i love the flavor of those tandoori chicken wings the lamb kabob was perfectly spiced to where you could still appreciate the flavor of the meat the service is great here and the prices are excellent im so happy i was able to find another restaurant that has high quality food with more than reasonable prices if youre looking for good pakistani & indian halal cuisine look no further first time trying indian food from a restarunt i am a huge fan of curries but this place was lacking  ordered the chicken masala if i remember right and was almost gritty because of seasoning  ordered the chicken tikka and the saffron sampler and all the meat was cooked to death really dry  maybe i dont know what indian food should be like but the meat seemed way over cooked  also got the cheese naan that was great its easy to miss in its quiet little center but my food eyes are vulter-ific and saw that a indian place was coming soon to the neighborhood we found they had a restaurantcom certificate and gave it a try when we walked in we were greeted with spices wafting around which was definitely a inviting sign!they start you off with cilrantro and tamarind chutneys with papadam to nosh while you wait bf has discovered tikka so we decide to get their chicken tikka ($14) so he can try more of it and see a range it was pretty nicely spiced and the chicken was tender  i prefer a bit richer almost creamy of a sauce but thats just a preference that i tend to seek so this isnt my favorite versionaloo ghobi ($13)- cauliflower potato and spices sauteed together the cauliflower was cooked nicely- soft but still with a light bite and the spices were flavorful but not overpowering they ask how spicy you want it from 1-10 we got a 2 and it doesnt really register any spicy at that point we want most things no spice to mild since the bf cant eat too spicy we also grabbed some garlic naan ($3) which was pretty good to go with the meal dishes comes with rice and they will refill it if you need more for dessert we got some gulab jamun ($5) which are fried milk dough balls that gets a bath in fragrant syrup and served warm the syrup had a light gingery taste to it and the dough was good there were two golf ball sized pieces and though they were tasty $5 is not proportional to what you got  $250 a ball is like grabbing a oreo sized cookie at bouchon bakery in the venetian and we aint on the lv strip service was attentive and nice we got our drinks and rice filled and we were checked oneven though we were full from our dishes for the price i feel it was a bit skimpy on the portions  i think the restaurantcom certificate was a good way to try this place definitely though this area needs a place like this to bring us to more food and culture diversity so i appreciate when a new spot opens up that is something different im curious about their lunch buffet im with rob on this one- probably coming back but not running back for more despite the fact that saffron is a little far north for us to drive a restaurantcom gift certificate combined with our love of indian food convinced us to give it a trywe arrived at about 7pm on a saturday and the place was deserted we were the only customers i worried about what the food would be like if no one else was here and if it was good how the place would survive by the end of our meal any worries were dispelled the food was delicious and the place was packed with hardly an empty tablethe meal began with some complimentary pappadums with the usual accompaniments of mint and tamarind chutneys  we started with a serve of samosas which i initially thought looked a bit dense but they turned out to be the most aromatic and delicious samosas i have eaten in las vegas and i found myself regretting not ordering a double servefor our mains we split a paneer makhani my wife had shahi paneer and i had chicken tikka masalamy tikka masala was delicious although it was a bit different to other tikka masalas i have had in the past having a bit of a vindaloo flavour i initially thought they might have mixed up my order but the chicken was definitely tikka with clear skewer holes in the meat either way it was absolutely divinemy wife absolutely loved her shahi paneer and when i helped myself to some and plenty of the ample gravy i agreed very rich and nutty and perfect fodder for the delicious serves of garlic and plain naan we ordered with our mealthe paneer makhani was also very good although i found it just a touch runny when compared to the wonderful consistency of the shahi dish if i had ordered it on its own i would have been more than satisfied but next time if we split a dish i think ill try some sort of kofta and see how that isthe restaurant itself is really attractive and welcoming when i read other reviews that said it was in a strip mall i had visions of a grotty row of shops with some cheesy red and green neon but the place looks really classy and the strip mall looks more like a business park and is only brought down slightly by the presence of a honking great mcdonalds out frontservice was great and friendly water was refilled promptly and they did well handling the sudden influx of crowdsprices were decent i would say the main dishes were a couple of bucks more expensive than your average indian restaurant and appetizers were a dollar or two cheaper than average so if youre ordering a bit of everything it should work out about evensaffron flavors of india is a great addition to a growing list of quality indian establishments in las vegas its of the highest quality and ranks among the very best to the point where the thirty to forty minute drive from home wont daunt us in our future dining decisions we will definitely be back my hubby and i were craving indian food tonight so we went to saffron  we ordered the chicken tikka masala vegetable korma veg samosas and the plain nan  we eat at saffron about once a week but the food was especially excellent tonight i will definitely go back to this place  before saffron i have been to only 3 indian restaurants which disappointed me enough to be wary of the cuisine altogether  i am so glad my husband took me here for something different  walked in had a saffron martini drop (an original creation) and decided yup this is gonna be goood! appetizer:chili chicken 5/10 spice: wow  bread basket:  garlic and cheese naan:  my son scarfed that down had chicken tikka masala and lamb masala: yum  staff were very nice restroom was clean  a bit of a drive from the strip but from this experience was well worth it the food is great but the hours are terriblei finally got a chance to go here after work  my 3rd attempt i tried a couple more times for lunch but they werent open  i wasnt in the mood for curry so i had me some chicken tikka i was thinkin some veggies so i got kachumber salad too the server suggested garlic naan also so when all the food came out i get embarrassed  the portions were huge that the cook came out to move another table next to mine i did the best i could but man vs food i am not i had enough leftover for the next day  my advise: bring a friend you wanna impressid come back when theyre open my hubby and i just did take out from saffron  we have a ritual where we share an indian beer and an ap at the restaurant and take the rest home  tonight the food was particularly on  the chicken tikka masala was perfect the veg korma was right on and the veg samosas were pretty great as well  this is the best indian restaurant in vegas and i could eat it every week yay! im a fanso i was going home from this side of town and i desired a bit of good eats to arrive home with  heres a shout-out to yelp for leading me to this place  i never would have stumbled across this tucked away place otherwiseeven if i happened upon this establishment im not even sure i would have guessed it to offer take-out  theres enough class inside that i actually asked if they even did and soon found out i would be one of three doing the same  there is a separate dining area from the bar but from the passersby i guess it to have accommodated them nicely  the bar area seems to have a full compliment and the tender definitely seemed to know his way around it (not that i sampled)  i sat at one of the few bar tables and watched the television they had up  i was very kindly offered water or soda while i waited for my order; a first for me when getting take-outafter perusing the entire dinner menu i settled on the chicken tikka masala -- caught my eye as it brings together the joys of the tandoor (grill/oven) with curry  luckily the dish comes with rice as you really dont get a lot for the money here  what you do get is quality over quantity but im a fan of both  i was asked on a scale of 1 to 10 how spicy i wanted it  after discussion that im a fan of a little heat we concluded that i should try an 8  well the 8 tickled some and it was flavorful -- not just spicy for its own sake  it certainly carried the graceful interplay of spices and textures of good indian food  it had an acceptable amount of chicken that was cooked to perfection  delish it was most definitely decided to visit this place during a weekend getaway to vegas after seeing reviews on yelp and trip advisor food: tastes great (we had chicken tikka masala butter chicken chili shrimp) spiced to taste smaller portions (one entry feeds 1 adult) garlic naan was excellent (kids swore it was the best theyve ever had) the fact that they had indo chinese choices was a huge plus as well only con was the dessert (they lost a star for this)- gulab jamun was not good at all and they still charged us for it even though i said it wasnt edible they serve it cold and the insides were rock hard overall this was the best indian food ive had in a very long timedecor: elegant nothing too fancy but tasteful in a quiet residential areaservice: very friendly at times a tad slow not too sure who our server was at times it was a guy at times it was the hostess who was quite nicecost: a little pricey (~ $15/entree) bill for 2 adults and 2 kids was ~ $100 without drinks this indian restaurant is a gem and is definitely worth visiting especially if you live in the nw part of the valley  i took my family and my sisters family from california and all seven of us absolutely loved the dining experience  we started off with vegetable samosas which were full of potatoes peas and maybe some carrots  while the pastry could have been a tad thinner and lighter it was delicious nevertheless  for $5 we got two large samosasfor our main course we ordered chicken tikka masala chana (chick peas) masala tandoori chicken garlic naan chili fish and garlic shrimp  the last two items were part of the indo-chinese section of the menu  every one of the dishes was well-prepared nicely presented and very flavorful   the restaurant was clean and spacious with ample parking  i have been to 8 or 9 different indian restaurants in las vegas and this one is one of the best i dont get over to the w side too often but decided to go out of my way to try this place after spending a morning working @ red rock casino recently no complaints about value- $12 lunch buffet in this towns pretty much the standardpretty decent # of items offered too specifically chicken tikka & korma saag paneer aloo ghobi garlic naan were all good ill be back our quest to find the best indian lunch buffet in vegas continues!protip: this isnt itmy wife and i had been here for dinner before and it was actually quite tasty so we trucked all the way up to craig on a weekday afternoon to try the buffet and sadly it didnt live up to our expectations based on dinner servicethe naan was still amazing but the buffet selection was downright paltry my firang side was pleased with the usual chicken tikka and pakora but i come to a lunch buffet to try a variety of different thingsif saffron would devote more space and effort to the lunch buffet instead of cramming a small selection into a tiny alcove it would be worth a return visit the food quality is actually very good but the limited selection just kills it for me what a total disappointment!! i was naive and did not listen to some of the reviews here the biggest complaint i have is price and quantity/quality of food i ordered chicken tikka masala and lamb with spinach curry or something like that first the flavor was nothing special i actually thought it was bland and something i could have made myself second the prices are ridiculous look i dont mind paying a lot of money if its worth it ive been to gordon ramsay on paris and del friscos double eagle steakhouse both expensive but totally worth it  the prices chicken tikka masala was $15 serve in a(i kid you not)dogs bowl size container(6 inches in diameter and 2 inches deep) 4 little cubes of chicken and the rest was sauce the lamb $16 same as the chicken tikka 4-5 little pieces and the rest was sauce i felt totally cheated i give this business a few more months and its going to close down people please listen up and spend it where you can get more bang and flavor for hour buck trust me on this one go to mt everest on sahara or something similar but not this one please!!! *update* to mr rajesh p who responded to my review yes!!! i am talking about the same saffron restaurant on w craig rd i spent 5 years in the uk and have dine in over 200 indian restaurants im pretty sure i know what i am talking about indian restaurants in europe are more authentic i may say so much so that at one point the uk made chicken tikka masala uks national food $14 or $15 it was still a small amount of food for the money just try going to one of the known indian restaurants around here and you know what i am talking about bottom line food quality/quantity is not worth the price and i believe people need to know this before going after hiking at mount charleston four of us stopped here to try their lunch buffet  one of our group has been here before and recommended it  it was a good recommendation!the buffet is small but is in the size range of others  at $1199 its price is ok  not the cheapest not the most expensive  the restaurant is attractive with comfortable seating  there is a separate section through which you enter where the bar is located  the buffet is in an adjoining area out of view from the dining roomthere was a selection of salad yogurt chutney and desserts at the beginning of the buffet  after the initial bar there were several chafing dishes with various foods  i tried the chicken tikka masala a curry chicken dal makhani onion pakora and some fried chicken balls--the name of which i cant remember  accompanying this was basmati rice  for the most part the dishes were good and flavorful  the dal was bland  it could have used some seasoning  the chicken balls were tasty and different  i should have gotten some chutney for that and the onion pakora but i failed to do so  next time  one of our group noted that the chicken tandoori was dry  i didnt try this but noted this for future reference  i made a second trip to the buffet to get something sweet to offset my disposition  i got one gulab jamun and it was very good  it was quite soft and it was not overly sweet  a very nice ending to lunchservice was average  we were there when the restaurant opened and it soon got busy but there were a couple of people working the small room  when i went to get my gulab my dirty plate was not removed  other than this things went okif im in the area id certainly stop again  it is in the middle tier of indian buffets ive tried  since its the closest place to where i live ill be back  i wouldnt recommend coming from the other side of town for the buffet when there are other places just as good or better in the unlv area,3.8125,16
Hurry 4 Curry,i was jonesing for chicken tikka masala after resisting the temptation to be the loser eating at an indian buffet alone i decided to try this new place id been hearing about after fighting downtown traffic and parking i walk up to the touch screen and discover no tikka masala super lame apparently the menu changes dailyi begrudgingly order the butter chicken and some naan i was pleasantly surprised! i was expecting a generic pei wei experience but aside from the naan being a little rubbery and oily it was actually quite tasty i really wish this place wasnt in the black hole that is the arizona center ercopper square whatever by the looks of how dead it is at lunchtime i dont know how good the survival rate is but im excited to go back and try some of the other items!,3.0,1
The Clay Oven,call me superficial call this trivial but theres just something a little bit special about having a takeaway delivered by a man in a three piece suit this has nothing to do with the quality of the food (which is excellent) but it definitely brightens up my dayive been getting take-aways from the clay oven for years we (as a flat) used to get the banquet for two between four of us you get (wait for it): chicken tikka massallam; lamb bhuna; mixed vegetable bhaji; alo gobi massallam; pilau rice (2 portions); sultana nan; kulfi yeah thats for two people so unless youve a huge appetite this works out at just shy of £6 per person for four (£2295) which makes it really good value otherwise it is one of the more expensive take-awaystop tip: ask them to swap the kulfi (a sort of weird indian frozen dessert) for another naan weve never had a problem doing that unless you really like kulfi you weirdo,4.0,1
Taj Mahal Indian Cuisine,ok im a huge indian food fan i have been to almost all of them in the city at least once my current favorite has been flavors of india on 16th street & cambell because it is near work and they make an awesome chicken korma let me state for the record that i never ever ever get the buffet which is pretty standard at most indian places in the valley aside from buffet-phobia i am a pretty big chili head i like hot in any shape and form this means i need to order off the menu and ask for it spicy i typically order indian spicy or the hottest you make it so i jumped off the 202 a bit early the other day because of traffic and headed north on scottsdale imagine my surprise to see taj mahal there at mckellips so close to my home stomping grounds i immediately made a mental note to try ittoday was that day i popped in to grab lunch take out for my wife and i the place was completely empty and there in the back was the requisite buffet (i didnt get close enough to it to see what it held) i sat at the bar and ordered the chicken tikka masala (mild rating 0) for her and the chicken vindaloo (as a 10) for me as well as an order of garlic naanlet me say i was impressed the chicken tikka was on par with any i have tried in the valley the garlic naan was better than most but i think the delhi palace in tempe has that beat the basmati rice was ok probably the least impressive part of the meal i really prefer it with a nice mix of crunchy bottom scrapings however! the real winner was my chicken vindaloo i am in love finally a place that actually brings the heat a 10 means 10 it was exactly the level of spiciness i crave and have yet to get in an indian restaurant in az i think i might still have a little endorphin high from it right now the flavor was phenomenal as well a nice rich flavor i like vindaloo because its not quite as heavy as some of the creamier ones and this one did not dissapoint a crisp deep flavor with a beautiful slow burn spicinessi am definitely a regular now in fact i am going to bring some fellow chili-head friends next weekend oh they also have a nice selection of indian beers more than is normally found at similar places you cant go crazy with the spice without some refreshing beers on hand right?if you like spicy or even just like indian food pop in and give it a go i will cry myself to sleep at night snuggling my plush habanero if this place goes out of business because of people not knowing about it ;)oh the prices off the menu were very affordable if my wife liked spicy (or vice versa) we could have easily split the one or the other $13 entree and been full lets call it a very strong 4 stars plus we came for dinner and it was all about the food at this family owned restaurant baby!our server harpreet (she also goes by happy) was charming and knowledgeable taj mahal offers the dinner menu dishes with a spiciness scale of 1-10 since we were dining with the kids we went on the low end of the scale we started with garlic naan and garlic cauliflower two quotes i have on the garlic naan are: best garlic naan ever! and uh-maze-ing the garlic cauliflower was a complete surprise we wanted to try something different and harpreet strongly recommended this she said if you dont like cauliflower dont worry even though none of us are big fans of cauliflower we decided to try it out wow! wonderfully garlicky and bursting with flavor! when we go back that is a must have for the entrees we shared navratan korma and chicken tikka masala both were marvelously colorful and flavor full as i write this i am forced to cover my keyboard with a napkin so that it doesnt short out from all the drooling produced by talking about the food we had the service was straight up 5 star the food solid 4-5 star range i would put the atmosphere at 3 stars but come here for the food i have not tried the buffet but i expect it would not be to the same freshness and quality having been here twice - once for dinner with the family and once for uye - yelp goes indian i feel its time to weigh in  on both our visits we were treated to impeccable service and incredible food  the owners hapreet and her husband make sure that when you leave you have been well fed and well cared forwe ordered similarly both times  we love the garlic cauliflower and garlic naan  i got korma both times first navratan and then lamb  my kids love chicken tikka masala and my husband jim w always wants something different  this time we added onion bhaji which i love and jim got some spicy paneer that i didnt tryheres the dish on this place:  these are really nice folks  the food is delicious  the service is impeccable  go thanks to the cable guy being a guest in our home until 8 pm last night we missed the yelp event  so in an attempt to undo also missing a previous event at taj mahal we decided to come heretypical strip mall restaurant with minimal decor but it was clean and pleasant  it surprised me to see a bar off to the side and indias version of mtv on the overhead television  there was only one other diner in the restaurant-good for me bad for them  we started with the garlic cauliflower  loved it!  for my appetizer i went with the ever popular chicken tikka masalachicken onion and bell pepper in a tomato based sauce  you can choose heat level up to 10  i prefer spicy but mild dishes with just a hint of heat  ordering a 1 fit the bill  the garlic naan was probably the best i have had of the 3 or 4 places i have been to  for dessert we had gulab gamun fried cheese balls soaked in sugar syrup  i had never had this before so i have no basis of comparison but i didnt really like it  i guess i expected it to to be cheesier and crispier and to be served hot (it was warm)  oh well cant win em allour service was great  i would have been disappointed had it been anything less with no one else in the restaurant for most of the meal  i can see taj mahal being a somewhat regular stop on our rotation  they just need some more customerswell when were not there anyway 5 stars  im indian and ive reviewed more indian restaurants in the valley than probably anyone on yelp i was not expecting this place to be so good based on the earlier reviews however there is a reason the food is much better; new ownership (including new chefs) took over 20 days ago this is probably the reason the last 3 reviews were 5 stars because they were within the period when the new owners took over the food is truly worth 5 stars and i was debating if it was better than guru palace for the best indian restaurant in the valley and guru palace slightly edges it but its closethe malai kofta is the best in the city and replaces royal taj has having the best the chicken tikka masala was flavorful and had a perfectly nice tomato flavor as opposed to just tasting like cream the palak paneer had the perfect texture but it was slightly underseasoned and undercooked but still very good i still think royal taj has the best palak paneer in the city  the only real complaints were the naan and rice dont get me wrong it was good but ive had much better naan elsewhere it was a little hard and thin but still tasted fresh  the rice was fairly standard of most of the indian restaurants in phoenix in that it was dry(overcooked) and had too much cumin thus far guru palace has the best rice in the citythey did the little things well my kingfisher ale was served in a chilled glass and the beer itself was cold sometimes indian restaurants can serve warm beer the papad wasnt burned and it was crisp and non greasy the service and vibe was nice it seems to be owned by a young indian couple who were very nice they speak great english are very trendy and friendly the wife served us and she was great and very friendly the restaurant was really clean and spacious as well which were pluses also the location was easy to find its at the southeast corner of mckellips and scottsdale rd in south scottsdalethe owners mentioned they will be renovating the inside so i have a feeling it will look more trendy and resemble guru palace and dhaba however its fine as it is now because its really clean albeit slightly bare i would say its in the top 3 and the only other 5 star indian restaurant in the valley besides guru palace and royal taj went here for the first time last weekend  we ordered the vegetable somoas chicken tikka masala the chicken vindaloo & keema naan  all were very good  service was excellentthe atmosphere was pretty blah though  the door handle on the front door was falling off and the dining area smelled of heavy cleaning solvents this place is fine--its close to home and will probably end up being our indian standbywe tried this place because we got a $25 gift certificate at a greatly discounted rate (try 80% off) on restaurantcom on the weeknight we went in we were the only people thereindian food makes great leftovers and we had a minimum amount we had to spend so we ordered up a stormwe started with mango lassis flat-out the best mango lassis ive had the fortune of trying theyre piquant fruity and very thick and creamy mmm mmm id go back just to suck down a few of thosethe naan was good too--i appreciated that they didnt bury it in cilantro im not a cilantro fan and i always--always--forget to ask indian places not to garnish with it the cilantro was there but not overpowering cool we got a paneer (cheese) naan and a garlic naan yummythe curries were where we were a little less impressed the eggplant curry (baygan bartha) was pretty heavy on the cinnamon and for a western palate was a little much i like my indian food spiced up the wazoo but cinnamon is one i appreciate them being light-handed with because its so often used in sweets herethe chicken coconut had great flavor and i dont think you could ask for more tender chicken but the chicken chunks were huge and seemed to have been just hacked apart--i got a huge chunk of very hard cartilage in my curry that idve rather not bitten down on their chicken coconut is not your usual chicken coconut korma/kurma so be warned in fact the indian waitress stared at me and asked me to clarify when i ordered chicken coconut kurma they have a basic chicken kurma on the menu and she wanted to know which one i wanted i just said chicken coconut and let it beas an other reviewer said the makhanis sauce is rather redder than ive seen it made before and it needs to be more than just sauce and chicken pieces other makhanis ive had have had cashews golden raisins and sliced peppers and i did miss that in this preparationthe chicken tikka masala too was missing something but for that one we couldnt put our fingers on it it was just a little different than  your usual tikka masala tasty but its lacking something who knowswe didnt try dessert because we were going to explode but based on the lassis im sure theyre pretty goodservice was more than fabulous--our waitress and the back waiter both took great care of us plenty of water always cleared the table when it needed itin short well be back but well be on the lookout for a knockout indian place too like many of the indian/ethnic restaurants in town its not much to look at  in fact when i rolled up into the big lots! strip mall it looked closed from the outside  however we braved it anyway and boy am i glad we did  we ordered veggie samosas (delicious filling the skin was a little on the thicker side like some of the egg rolls in chinese buffets but that didnt distract from the tastiness of it)the chutneys were some of the best and freshest ive tasted in a long timethe chicken tikka masala was rich and creamy just the way i like it  we ordered also the lamb roshan josh (spelling?) which was amazing  i usually order lamb vindaloo but will be eating this from now onthe garlic naan was buttery and flavorfulthe naan filled with lamb was only okay half of the pieces didnt actually have lamb in it  the cheese pakoras were bland  i will say that the rice was tasty but was a little harder than im used toooverall a solid takeout place if you dont want to eat in the restaurant  the spiciness really does love up to the scales  a medium really does have a nice slow chilli burn without being overpowering  the portions were on the smallish side but no smaller than lots of other indian restaurants  definately worth checking out was referred to this place by a friend who swore by the foodsadly we never got that farwe arrived just before 7pm waited about 5 minutes to be seatedthey took our order quickly and got us drinkswe ordered the assorted appetizer platter garlic naan matar paneer and the chicken tikka masalawe sat for 20 minutes before the platter came out with no sauceswe then sat for another 40 minutes while 4 different tables who came in after us had their order taken were served ate and got to-go boxeswe asked to pay for the appetizer platter and then left our waiter who was very nice and apologized wouldnt take the paymenti dont know if this was an off night orwont be coming back here,3.6666666666666665,9
Kabob N More,bad service is it possible to give negative stars? my family and i came in for lunch and the owner was very rude when i asked a question about the menu he had a bad attitude he raised his voice at me when i told him i didnt receive the plate of rice i ordered the food was not good we ordered pizza kabobs salad chicken tikka masala and another chicken dish no one like their food i would never come back here again and hope i  can save someone  from a horrible experience go somewhere else!,1.0,1
Sutra Fine Indian Cuisine,weve been twice for the buffet we are happy to report that sutra has one of the tastiest and most diverse indian buffets in town favorites include chicken tikka masala and vegetable pakoras diners are given a choice of plain or garlic naan its not all raves and applause - the bismati rice was a bit over or undercooked (crunchy) on my last visit and on both occasions the owners long-winded chit-chat actually kept us from enjoying our lunch while it was still piping hot still as far as indian restuarants in the valley go this one is tops we hope sutra opened in april 2009 will be a fixture in goodyear we dont want to go back to driving to glendale or tempe to find decent (or meh) indian cusine! yes! so happy to find indian food in the southwest part of the valley! went here for the lunch buffet - good selection of vegetarian and non vegetarian options my favorite was the chicken tikka masala - really flavorful and tender - i was able to cut through it with a fork ill definitely be back!,4.0,2
Royal India Bistro,we went to the $14 (11am to 4pm) lunch buffet  we had been there twice before for dinner when it was gaylord and both experiences were quite similar; nice ambiance good but overpriced food lousy service  so i was excited they were back (same owners new name) and could do a major affordable chow down and not have to worry about the service because it was a buffet  really what could possibly go wrong?so there we are-nobody to seat us-so i poke my head into the dining area and someone comes and ushers us to a table in a near empty room  i look around; wow design fallout!  the gaylord to india bistro remodel is more of a demodel what was once a rather upscale and attractively appointed space has been dehabbed with cheesy booths and a tacky over bright chandelier oh well moving onthe buffet consisted of: dal maharani  baingan pakoras (eggplant) aloo baingan (think it was potato and eggplant) palak paneer  basmati rice tandoori chicken chicken tikka masala chicken curry and some expired salada little heavy on the chicken and eggplant but i was still ok with thatuntil i discovered that every chicken dish was a contender for the food despair jackpot  the one commonality they all shared was their styrofoam taste and consistency  it was the worst rice i have ever had and we debated if it was old or undercooked settling on the notion that it was probably both  everything else pretty much sucked as well  there are people starving in (fill in the blank) and they would probably choose hunger over that buffet  the only plus:our server kept us attentively stocked with the only palatable things we had:garlic naan & water the lunch buffet is ok the tandoori chicken chicken tikka masala and naan are good the rest of the buffet was either dying in the chafing dish or not very appetizing the yogurt curry was sour the saag was desiccated and the salad looked a bit on the dead side but for $1495 in vegas having enough good dishes to fill you up is passable just had dinner service was great and staff was friendly my hubby had the non vegetarian complete dinner and i had the chicken tikka masala and it did not disappoint ive only had indian food a handful of times in my life but this place was good i dont have anything bad to say about it for appetizers the garlic naan bread bhaji onion ring type dish and the vegetable samsoa are all worth getting  for main courses the chicken tikka masala & shrimp vindaloo were both very good too  i would have to try some other places before i could compare it but i definitely recommend trying this place for yourself  service & food both solid i went to the royal india bistro for the lunch buffet today  lunch was very good and service was excellent i was the first person here at about 11:30 but several tables were occupied before i left  the server asked me for my drink order  i got tap water which  she then said they had a buffet and i replied that was the reason i was there  she gestured for me to go ahead and start and shed get my naanthe buffet is small by comparison to other indian buffets in town  there are 8 hot dishes some salad and achaar  it was a good enough choice and the good taste of the food made up for the limited selectionthe naan was buttered generously and was a welcome addition to the mealfor my first trip i got chicken tikka masala malai kofta and some basmati rice  the thing i noticed about all of their dishes was they all had a nice spicy flavor  its not overpowering for people who like mild food but it had a definite tang and it was not just one dish but all of them  it was the first time i know that i had malai kofta and it was really a treat!  the last thing was the vegetable pakora  this was a bit disappointing  i didnt read the full description because i know what it is  the only vegetable i could see/taste was potato  it seemed more like it was a pakora made from bread stuffing and some potatofor the second plate i had aloo matar daal maharani and curry chicken  the aloo matar and curry chicken were good  the daal was ok  the sign said spicy lentils but this was the only dish that was lacking in spice  there were some beans mixed in the daal toofor dessert i got some rice pudding and some carrot pudding  the rice pudding was not labeled as kheer and it had a lot of liquid with less rice unlike kheer or rice puddings ive had before  the carrot pudding on the other hand was very thick and unlike the carrot puddings ive had elsewhere  both puddings were very good--im not criticizing them but merely pointing out the different preparation  i wish i had seen the achaar at the beginning of my meal  i didnt think it would be as tasty with dessert!service as i said was very good  when i went for my second plate my dirty plate was removed and my water glass refilled  the server was very pleasant  the room is quite nice and it was very quiet  the price is just over $16 including tax  for the limited selection its higher than most places  also you have to park and walk your way through the casino to get there and its right in the middle halfway between either garagestill i wont hesitate to stop here and i think ill try it for dinner some evening,3.2,5
Indian Curry Bowl,this girl (*points to self with both thumbs) is soooo lucky to have good eats around her!  woot  indian curry bowl is another semi-fast food/semi-sit down joint in the northwest las vegas area and also down the street from market grille cafe  its located just down from fresh & easy and in the same shopping center as 24hr fitness and cafe rioall the dishes are mom-cooked and the mamas and staff are all super nice too!even though i havent tried everything i can confidently jump to the conclusion that everything is probably pretty good  the curry isnt as thick as other curries ive had but i definitely like the flavor resulting from all the spices  you can asked for the chili on the side if youre eating with people with different acceptance levels of heat  personally i luv that stuff! gimme gimme gimme heres what i tried so far (per the owner all chicken used in dishes is chicken breast)1  garlic naan - slightly charred but it was nice and chewy  lil bit of burnt taste gives it flavor haha2  vegetable samosa - deep fried but not too greasy at all  when do i ever say no to deep fried?3  butter chicken - similar to chicken tikka4  chicken tikka masala (tomato based curry)5  chicken saag (spinach based stew)6  chicken korma (coconut based curry)ps  they have a lunch special for a curry bowl thats $595+ depending on the extras you get  yummy curry on fluffy rice = happy lunch time nap i love eating here  it is my favorite indian restaurant in las vegas i usually get the chicken tikka for guilt free dining but everything on the menu is great  i highly recommend the korma dishes i ordered the lunch special: butter chicken (and also ordered the lunch special chicken korma and mango lassi to go)the only other indian place ive been to was mt everest during the lunch buffet and mint and then i was hooked to indian food i am by no means an expert in indian food so bear that in mindnow the food comparing the chicken makhani (butter chicken) from here to everest and mint indian curry bowls is a lot less creamier with more of a spicy raw tomatoey kick since im so accustomed to that super creamy milky tomato sauce at first i was a bit disturbed but as i continue to eat i wondered if there was also a healthy version of indian food  by no means was it bad in fact it felt extremely healthy and expertly made with spices and such its just i wanted that thick super creamy sauce (which i dont even know if thats authentic it just appeals to my taste buds more)service was good establishment hired a new waitress checked if everything was okay drink was filled etc nothing stellar but i never really had high hopes either way its not some super fancy restaurant in the first place id go back the total for two lunch specials (butter chicken and chicken korma) with mango lassi was near $20 oh and since so many people kept complaining about portions we must have some beastmode eaters here i eat a lot and it was enough for me to feel really full although takeout will be a liiiiiiiittle smaller in portions because of the plastic container they use and i have a sneaking suspicion that maybe instead of giving me butter chicken they gave me that chicken tikka thingy? which i heard isnt as creamy as butter chicken hmmm well ill give it another go!-----------updated----------ordered the butter chicken again this time although the texture was still a bit watery the taste had that creamy milky taste i was served by arnand this time perhaps he was in an iffy mood today? wish the new waitress served me this time she was a lot more friendlier had the chicken naan lamb samosas chicken tikka and the chicken korma  the korma we ordered mild spice it was a little watery and since we went 2 months ago the portion size had diminished  the chicken tikka my hubby ordered #10 super-hot it was not but had some heat to it  the samosas were tasty but a bit greasy and the naan was a hit with my 1 and 3 year olds  overall definitely going back the food comes out piping hot and freshly made which i love and all of the flavors are there that i look for in indian food  this is a nice little family-owned restaurant with polite and prompt service but relaxed enough to seat yourself  i love it and i try to go every few months we ordered lunch from indian curry bowl yesterday and i cant say enough about how horrible it was  not just the food but the entire experience  the food was very overpriced  for 2 entrees 1 side and 2 orders of samosas the total came to $72!!  i was shocked and looked over the receipt  they were charging me $10 for chutney??!?  i eat indian food from many different establishments on a regular bases and the chutney is always complimentary  its like charging for ketchup  while i was waiting for my order i was watching the elderly woman prepare the food using a microwave  really?  no burners or stoves going just a couple of microwaves  the food was not good at all  the samosas were soggy and undercooked the chicken tikka masala and saag paneer were runny and looked like they literally had been mixed with water  so basically i paid over $70 for food that was microwaved (seriously im still appalled by that one) and terrible  never again!!!! food was mediocre at best chicken tikka masala was not creamy had very little chicken and had no real flavor saag paneer was relly runny and the cheese was tough the naan was good but how can you screw up naan? severely overpriced  the owner acted like he was doing me a favor with the prices and said that he had new menus already printed with higher prices i will definitely not be returning the wife and i ended up here today after discovering that saffron - flavors of india has temporarily closedim sad to report that this place is easily the worst a la carte indian experience i have had in las vegasmy wife ordered paneer tikka masala and i ordered my standard chicken tikka masala we also had our standard mix of garlic and plain naan which we love to use the mop up all the lovely rich creamy gravy that you usually associate with indian food and these dishes in particularwhat arrived was not rich creamy or even remotely lovely they seem to take the healthy take on indian food to extremes here my tikka masala looked like it had been prepared by throwing a few pieces of chicken tikka into a mixture of blended onion tomato green peppers and cilantro which had then been cut with about a cup of water until watery and tasteless we heard the microwave going during the preparation so id say thats pretty much exactly what was happeningimagine what youd get if you microwaved a can of (if it existed) progresso low fat low sodium indian curry chicken soup theres something extremely wrong with your chicken tikka masala when no matter how many times you re-dip your chicken in the sauce it comes up completely devoid of anything covering it the chicken itself was bland waterlogged and soaked free of any flavour whatsoeverwe didnt really have much use for our naan since there was no real gravy here but my garlic naan was pretty tastelessthe only minor saving grace of the meal was the excellent home made lemonade and the passable samosas we began our meal with to round things all off a bill of close to $50 for a terrible meal in a restaurant that felt like a subway landed on the table and i knew the second star i was going to award this place just for the lemonade and friendly service was gone  if youre a health fanatic who likes vaguely chili flavoured water with your chicken paneer etc then this place might be for you if your looking for wonderful silky sauces and creamy nutty tastes run as far from indian curry bowl as you can cute restaurant food mediocre and not authentici guess this place caters to gringo palates we ordered samosas which were pretty good the naan was a bit lacking in flavor myself and a companion who were familiar with indian cuisine ordered the matar paneer and vegetable kofta food wasnt bad but lacking in spice and deep traditional indian flavor this was disappointing as we had specifically requested that our food be very spicy the rest of our party ordered lamb korma and chicken tikka masala and were generally pleased as they liked their food on the milder sidethe owner (who acted as our waiter) was stingy with the rice he brought us one bowl for five people and gaped at us when we asked for more mid dinner service not that we were being greedy but this was like the size of a cereal bowl (when most indian restaurants will give you a serving bowl) he then proceeded to bring us  half a cereal bowl full of rice then said ok guys this is all we have --reallyhe then paced around the restaurant then glared at us until we lefti understand that we came about an hour before closing which can be annoying for most restaurant staff but there were also two other couples dining way to get your message across i get it you want us to get the f*ck out notedso we quickly finished and left needless to say i will not be returning ive had better indian food in the backwoods of north carolina service  was fast food is ok in a pinch if youre desperate but for me indian curry bowl is to indian food as taco bell is to mexican food,2.875,8
Indian Delhi Palace,my husband is the fan of indian food and i had a gift certificate from some students so we gave indian delhi palace a try  the service was spotty depending on who was in our section at the time  the naan and puri were excellent and both of our entrees were tasty (my husband had the chicken tikka masala and i had a mild lamb dish in cream sauce the jasmine rice was beautiful and well cooked but also had cardamom seeds in it (not my favorite) my husband loved his palak paneer we agreed that overall we have had a little better food and service from taste of india first off i must say friendly smiles upon entering an establishment goes a looooong way for me family owned and nurtured with love comes through at indian delhi palace ive eaten in a few times and mostly had take out service was always right on attentive not intrusive take out packaging is an art in my book so often things are forgotten mispackaged and spilled and well sometimes just tossed in a bag here they do it right garlic naan bread in house is better than to go unfortunately they wrap it in tinfoil and it sweats and loses any of it crispy outer crunch chicken tikka marsala has just enough cream and spice to hit all my f spots (you know like a g spot only f for flavor!) saffron rice is fluffy flavorful and fantastic rickie loves their sauteed okragenerally not something high on my list to order but yowza potsiedee - lish samoras tandori chicken all as all around and you cant beat a tall cold himalyan beer while waiting for that to go order and they always provide me with some papadum and a tangy sour spicy dip remember a smile goes along way with me! fantastic chicken tikka masala and garlic naan!  gulab jamun is good but not the best ive had  i didnt like the palak paneer  service is friendly and efficient  preparation of food can take awhile so dont arrive starving  lunch buffet available and you can even take lunch buffet to-go!  (havent tried it yet though so i cant vouch for the food served)ooh ive got to get this on my rotation soon! avoid the lunch buffet  excellent chicken tikka masala coda b and i both crave indian lunch buffets when were hungover him more so than me hes actually called me at 12:30 at night from a bar talking about how he wants indian food its as though he can already feel the hangover coming on and wants to make sure his priorities are in check 1) get home (or wherever) safely 2) indian food i may have mixed up the orderthis indian delhi palace is apparently under the same ownership as the tempe location but i like this one much better for several reasons:1) the chicken tikka masala is amazing like ive never had buffet food this good before i dont really like tandoori chicken honestly the color kind of freaks me out i know its from the sauce or whatever but chicken on the bone with a kind of fluorescent pink glow is weird ill pass but boneless chicken in a delightful red curry sauce? dont mind if i do!2) this location has a much larger variety of dishes especially vegetarian dishes which are usually my favorite offerings at an indian lunch buffet (see above about tandoori chicken freaking me out)3) um hello? it looks like a freaking palace these guys did not hold back and i freaking love them for it i actually think more places offering a lunch buffet should treat its patrons like the hungover royalty that we are i wouldnt mind if souper salad and sweet tomato hopped on this trend already i mean how hard can it be to add a few fancy door arches and some gold plated silverware? not that hard really up your game guyshowever the only complaint i have about indian delhi palace and the primary reason why flavors of india remains my favorite indian lunch buffet has to do with the atmosphere yes i appreciate the super sexy high-class water goblets but delhi palace doesnt have any booths and when im hungover i need a freaking booth i need my own little eating sofa i need to be able to kick off my flip flops under the table and sprawl out like im enjoying their delicious naan on my own little loveseat thats what i need and thats what flavors of india gives me oh and some bollywood wouldnt hurt either finding good indian food in phoenix has made the move here easierespecially a place thats a mile from my houseparking is easyservice is always fantastictake-out is always ready very quickly and very hotgood variety of spices at the attached little storetried and recommend: shahi paneer chicken tikka masala veg korma chana masalamight revisit but not thrilled with initially: saag paneer aloo gobiif you like spicy (or not) tell them--they go kinda easy on the hotness unless you specifically ask (use the 1-10 scale)i wish it was a little less formal feeling inside but i typically do take-out so not a big deal--it just makes for a date-ish environment rather than a group o friends environment  again not a bad thing im just sayin ive also never checked out the lunch buffet so maybe the white tablecloths and preset water glasses are a pm thing [ps im now officially amused that i just said i wished a place was less nice dont really hear that too often] i may be biased as this is the first indian restaurant ive ever eaten at but i love it my sister and i have date night here about once a month we look forward to gorging on their delicious naan chicken tikka masala palak paneer and rice those dishes are so good wonderfully flavored and full of awesome i love spinach my sister hates it once i got her to try the palak panner she was hooked! now we fight over who gets the last piece of cheese their chicken tikka is the best ive had the chicken is flavorful and the sauce has a creamy and silky texture perfect to dip your naan in weve also had their butter chicken and chicken curry both were excellent they also offer traditional indian dinners (vegetarian and meat) which have a little bit of everything theyre great for introducing indian food to first timers oh and the mango lassi is delicious! since everything is a la carte it can get pricey but the portions are generous i have yet to try their lunch buffetit has a really nice atmosphere and is never overly crowded so you can have a nice conversation the decor is also lovely the staff is very friendly and helpful they have a small market attached full of spices medicines bangles hena kits and other various food itemsreally great restaurant! weve recently moved to phoenix and weve been looking for a fantastic indian restaurant (and i think weve found it!)the restaurant is nice with nice decor the service was friendly and quick the waiter was a pro and we loved one to ten spicy-scale for our dishes i ordered veggie korma he got the chicken tikka masala  and we shared some naan and the assorted snacks (vegetable pakora samosa sheesh kabab papadum) everything was delicious giant food baby well be back for the lunch buffet and we cant wait this place was disappointing on different levels first the food was okay but not great i thought the naan was below average and tasted more like flatbread than what naan is supposed to taste like my dish was the chicken tikka masala and it just lacked flavor and any hint of spiciness i did get the mango shake and it was truly excellent!the waiter seemed quite inpatient throughout the night on a couple instances he assumed what we meant instead of getting clarification; thus bringing out the wrong thing then the restaurant turned off the music 10 minutes before closing and basically tried to rush us out seriously??? not a way to keep business coming back! i mean chill out most of us were pretty much finishing up at that point so at least give the diners the courtesy of a full experiencetoo many better options to want to come back here my all time favorite at idp chicken tikka masala peas rice & garlic naan!!! yummm i was checking the reviews when i saw the yelp coupon and bought it! we ordered: samosas chicken tikka masala ($1099) palak paneer ($899-spinach and cottage cheese) and goat masala (1199?) im not a frequenter of indian cuisine establishments so i cant really compare it to others but the chicken tikka masala was amazing! palak paneer was also great the goat masala was good not gamey at all! they definitely dont clean the bones away very well so be careful not to chip a toothserver was not overly friendly but good enough between him and the 2 bussers who were prompt to refill our waters from ordering a little too high on the spicy scale :)i need to come back for the lunch buffet for $899 sometime! i went here for lunch on a sunday the parking lot had quite a few cars but i got right in :-) i got the buffet and had the chick peas salad (very good) chicken tikka masala (flavor was great but the chicken was slightly dry) goat masala (this was amazing) and their tandoori chicken (which was some of the best i have had) overall a great lunch would have done 5 stars if it wasnt for the dry chicken tikka one word chicken tikka masala!okits one word if you say it like i do i like to say it fast so i can hurry up and get past the ordering part and on to the eating partthis place is awesome i ordered samosas garlic naan mixed grill (tandoori oven cooked variety of meats) and chickentikkamasala *giggle* the mixed grill was good but the naan and the masala was the highlight i had to slap the hubbys hands to keep him from eating the whole thingokby slap i mean i may or may not have skewered his fingers with the fork pinned them to the table and gleefully devoured the tender saucy piece of chicken as he sniffled something about needing an ambulancewere so playful disclaimer: *no hubbies were actually harmed or manhandled before during or after the consumption of the delicious items procured from idp the improvised narrative describing the dinner-eating portion is fictionalthe tastiness of the items we ordered is factual big bunch of family over so we created our own buffet!  shrimp biryani veggie biryani tandoori shrimp and tandoori chicken chicken tikka masala palak paneer samosas raita and lots of naan (plain cheese and garlic)  everyone loved the chickenwhich i dont eat but others said it was good  i loved both biryanis and the paneer with raita over it  i also loved the naan dipped in masala sauce! so glad its close to home! all i have to say is - im a punjabi and i endorse this messageportfolio - chicken tikka masala chana masala palak paneer garnished with courteous service a gem in the middle of this desert,4.066666666666666,15
Bombay Spice Grill,the second location of bombay spice is now open!  its conveniently located on the north west corner of tatum and shea in the whole foods/soma cafe shopping centeri went with a group of 7 on tuesday night for dinner and 6 out of 7 of us loved it sorry again marc - i felt awful that we all enjoyed and you did not  let me explain:since id been to the 16th street location before i suggested bombay spice to mix things up a bit  the group i was with are pretty healthy health conscious so i thought they may enjoy indian food done healthywe shared the chickpea ceviche as an appetizer and then most of us ordered the different rice bowls as entrees  we had fun with the variety of sauces too  favorite choices included the cauliflower eggplant chicken tikka masala and veggie tofu tikka as well as the mint hot and curry sauces  unfortunately marc is allergic to onions and everything he attempted to order had onions in it  by the time he placed an order for plain chicken and rice we were all almost done and the kitchen was slammed and didnt prioritize his order (as they should have)  so marc didnt eat  :(i will return for sure for the food - its prepared for the health conscious eater and it is not as heavy as traditional indian food - i happen to like that!  note: if you are allergic or really hate onions be careful about ordering so you dont starve like my friend marc did! i met a friend here for lunch today because i needed to get out of the house (thank you kylee if you are reading this) i also had a craving for indian now im also trying to watch what i eat so bombay spice seemed to be a good optionlets get one thing out of the way if indian food was a bike this would be a tricycle or something with training wheels meaningthis isnt authentic indian food that said its very good and very healthy its a little light on spice but the food still has good flavor they have shakers of garam masala and another spice mix that has red chiles in it but the name escapes me additionally the entrees come with raita and a choice of another spice so if youd like more heat order the hot sauce which i did it provided the extra heat i was looking fori got the shrimp tikka masala and the eggplant with a side of brown rice a papadum and a whole wheat chappti huge freaking portions of the rice and eggplant the shrimp was disappointingjust three shrimp swimming in a sea of sauce now the sauce was good but three? come on give me a little more my dining companion had the chicken tikka masala and cumin potatoes her portions were equally as big she also ordered the tamarind sauce which was nice almost a bit like teriyaki sauce all of the food came out within minutes of us orderingi also enjoyed the wine list glass are $6 flights are $9 and a bottle is $20 our server also said that we could order a bottle and if we didnt finish it theyd cork it and let us take it one thing i particularly like about bombay spice is the ability to order online i hate ordering on the phone because it always seems like a recipe for disaster; you never get what you ordered the ability to order online is also a life saver when youre like me frequently stuck on a teleconference but desperately hungryi left happy and full and i cant wait to return here with my family and friends i highly recommend bombay spice for people who have never experienced indian food but are curious about it do not come here if you want indian cuisine! i should have read other reviews more closely  do i really want hummus or ceviche at an indian restaurant? this place is more for wine and tapas  the decor is very hip and trendy but i dine out for the food and i thought the food was bland and tasteless  entrees were high at $14 each plate and comes 2 dishes served with rice and chapati bread (wheat tortilla)food arrived not hotmy friend had vegetarian curry; veggies had that frozen food rubbery texture cumin potatoes were sour  my chicken keema and chicken tikka masala was bland and niether dish had flavor  my basmati rice was clumpy and sticky :(i did not like the ginger green tea it tasted like licorice i dunno maybe im too harsh and narrow minded  i did feel underwhelmed and disappointed the food is not amazing i love indian food im constantly driving through this intersection and have always wanted to try it  i finally got the chance and on top of that it was lunchtime and their sign said lunch specials  i arrived around 11 am and the place is empty  i ordered the dinner portion as i was sharing with my child  $13 for chicken curry & chicken tikka masala  i also ordered a side of plain naan  the entree came with a row of rice that separated the two choices i made  the rice tasted like something that came from uncle bens--no flavor and every time i scooped up rice there was a lot of water-soaked rice underneath  the chicken curry and chicken masala tasted the same one was red the other wasnt  again very little flavor  how can indian food lack so much flavor???  the naan was just a flat bread nothing important about it but it vaguely reminded me of the frozen naan they sell at trader joes and when i started thinking about it so did the curry & masala  i ended up spending over $20 dollars for my meal that i shared with my young child  i felt like i could have gotten the same thing at trader joes sans the watery rice for about $10 i gave this place two stars just based on the great service the waitress gave and another for it trying to be a healthy indian restaurant  trust go to the indian buffet in the airpark although its the real deal its worth the money and calories! well at least the owner is consistent  as with roka akor this place had great style in the decor but the food just was not very good  we ordered chicken tikka masala and a curry  both of the sauces were flavorful and balanced but none of the flavors penetrated the meats in the curries  it almost tasted like the curry was cooked in one pot the meat was boiled in water and the meat was dropped into the curry at the last minute  maybe its the old school in me but its such a waste to order a meat dish and leave the meat behind  the search continues for good indian food in my hood this place touts healthy indian food - ive never heard of such a thing!was pleasantly surprised with my dinner ordered the plate with lamb curry and chicken tikka masala the lamb pieces were nice and tender and the flavor was great the chicken tikka masala was not as rich as im used to but it too had good flavor  both were quite spicy and made me appreciate the dollop of raita which was served with the meal   i liked that they gave you the choice of brown rice or basmati the healthy spin was definitely an upside but it took away from the full potential of flavorservice was ok they werent that busy while i was there but the servers chatted amongst themselves until they were waived downfood was good but if youre looking for a traditional indian meal this isnt the place for you this is definitely not traditional true indian food  we ordered naan and receivedpita bread warmed up and sliced in quarters the nerveto label something on the menu as naan and then serve pita bread that looked like it just came out of a bag from whole foods and today they were out of chicken tikkagasp sigh the chicken masala was bland but the chicken curry was tasty but not noteworthy  the chickpea ceviche was goodthe service was attentive and responsive i would suggest to try it at lunchtime to save $ and try a few things to see if you might like it i was told a while back to try bombay spice my husband and i are changing our lifestyle by eating healthy this is a great option for anyone looking for a healthy alternative i liked the option to have brown rice or lettuce wraps they also have tofu which is difficult to find at most places we tried the sauce sampler seared salmon chicken tikka masala veggie curry and chicken curry everything was very good was a great change from the usual chain restaurants tried bombay spice last night after reading the website and reviews it seemed like it would fit perfectly our combined need to finally find good indian fare in phoenix and not blow our calorie budget (husband and i are trying--and succeeding!-- in losing weight) success on both counts!it was saturday at about 6:30 and we were seated immediately the place was almost full we sat on the patio which was lovely but might get too hot during the summer (i didnt see any misters--youre welcome mother earth!)  service was attentive and our waitress gave us several recommendations we ordered:somosas (baked i think not fried which made them a little messier to eat but still very very tasty)naan (chewy moist naan-yyum)grilled shrimp skewers (a little on the skimpy side but very tasty and served with grilled peppers and onions and a delightful mint sauce)we each ordered individual entrees with basmati they encourage you to order the two-entree choice but we were trying to avoid over-ordering and it turned out to be exactly the right amount of food i ordered the cauliflower and potatoes which was moist savory a little spicy and very tasty albeit lacking a little in the sauce department (i would have liked a little something to spoon over my rice)husband ordered the chicken tikka masala which was exceptional they claim that they dont use cream in their food so i dont know how they made the masala sauce so creamy and good but they did and im not going to question it any more! i would have licked the bowl if we had been at home next time i think well get some apps again but try the bombay plate to share which is 5 entree choices and rice that way we can try a whole bunch of things $35 before tip for naan two appetizers and two single-choice entrees not bad for a saturday out well definitely be back even though it was  kind of a drive for us rave alert! this place has an awesome happy hour! i mean super awesome the line on their menu describing the food as authentic flavors refined is too accurate to improve upon! all the things that usually make me want to sprint in the opposite direction of an indian restaurant: buffet style setup clashing colors poor presentation poor service and funky smells were not present at bombay spice in other words the experience was much less of a culture shock for me; elegant and modern style decor dine-ware and silverware did the trick the staff was very friendly and helpful i cant wait to go back! i had the indian chai latte chicken tikka samosa and carrot halwa total bill before tip: $574 how can i not give this place 5 stars? i mean seriously! what id recommend: going for their amazing happy hour as well as their indian chai latte chicken tikka samosa and carrot halwa i dont know what youd call this place - fusion indian food? definitely a westernized take on indian food the only upside being that they really seem to cater to vegans vegetarians and gluten-free diners but the food was just not a good representation of what vegans vegetarians or even indians eat! terribly bland i had the mango salad - which had no mangoes in it i am pretty sure it should have been called pseudo mango salad if i order something called mango salad i fully expect some nice juicy chunks of the fruit the boyfriend ordered a chicken tikka wrap - supposedly wrapped in naan seemed more like a regular tortilla i had a bite the flavor was okay i much prefer the nann wraps at tandoori times - they are for one definitely wrapped in naan and two exploding with flavor - and at the same pricethe ambiance was okay a modern sort of cafe the service was no good really slow and i wouldnt say particularly friendly this was the first and last time well ever go i am newly gluten free and dairy free (although not a vegan) id been dying to try a tikka masala but had never been able to due to the common use of cream in the dish i was amazed to find this restaurant had extensive gf and vegan menu options our server (also possibly the owner or manager?) was patient and knowledgeable about my requests the lentil towers were delicious the chicken tikka masala was rich and savory and delicious and even came with some gf bread for dipping i also loved the iced tea i look forward to returning to this place i tried this place out with a friend recently and was pleasantly surprised the vibe of the place was a bit americanized but beyond that the food was delicious catching the tail end of their 4-6 pm happy hour we ordered a half-dozen mild tandoori wings for only $4 and they were amazing we also tried the lamb vindaloo and the chicken tikka masala and both were also delicious the vindaloo though is definitely for the more adventurous; its insanely spicy! in total with tax and tip we spent around $20 per person for a nice dinner in a comfortable atmosphere and our waitress was lovely! definitely worth a try and ill be sure to go back i was really pleased with bombay spiceits definitely not your typical indian restaurant setting think more contemporary american decor i mean the smiths were playing on the stereo which gave it a nice relaxing casual vibe we were served by a great friendly waitress who really knew the food and explained everything real well you can tell she was very excited about it we started with the appetizer sampler which had four selections of appetizers of your choosingall were outstanding especially the wings and the chickpea ceviche  i then tried the chicken tikka masala which had lots of great flavor and a nice kick then we checked in on yelp and got a free dessert great prices and the way you order the food makes it really simple great little casual place tucked away in the corner of a strip mall near pv mall i went to bombay spice not long after moving to paradise valley from scottsdale  i knew that it was a healthier indian food but i didnt know that meant they didnt use salt  at all  got a cup of lentil soup and while i could taste the spices in it it was watery and bland  the texture was really off-putting  the chicken tikka masala with cauliflower was no better  it was a huge portion but bland bland bland  the naan i liked even though it is clearly non-traditional and clearly not homemade  i will never ever come back here and waste my money on bland food again i was a little disappointed that my server didnt offer me the bottomless weekend lunch special the weekend lunch special is something like $1195 and all you can eat appetizers lunch plates and dessert i had it last time and it was very good  at the time i thought they discontinued it but the table next to me got the menu for it but i still had an enjoyable lunch here anywaythey offer an appetizer sampler plate where you pick four appetizers for $1195 i picked chickpea ceviche lentil cake towers chicken tikka kebab and chicken seekh kabab my husband liked the seekh kabab best and said to him it tasted like sausage and peppers i thought everything was tasty and flavorful and the chicken was prepared very well being moist tender and flavorful it was a good amount of food but not quite enough for two people so we shared a hot chicken vindaloothe vindaloo was very spicy and chicken was very moist tender and flavorful i thought this dish was presented very nicely with the indian style bread ( naan) and cracker  (papadum)this dish cost $945 and i added mixed vegetables to the dish for a $100 more i dont mean to knit pick but if im being totally honest i need to mention my server told me the mixed vegetables were a mix of the vegetable choices like cauliflower eggplant and other stuff but what i recieved were similar to frozen mix you buy at the store (carrots peas corn but i wont dwell on that and let it slide) id make a different vegetable selection next timethe food here is americanized indian style food that is mostly low fat and healthy they offer healthy side dishes like quinoa and brown rice no butter or ghee is in the house they use olive oil instead the restaurant is casual but stylishthey also are accommodating to vegans and vegetarians drive by here all the time and have never stopped seen it in several magazines great atmosphere inside service is nice and friendly had the weekend bottomless brunch special for $1195 it is like a buffet but you tell them what you want off a special menu and they cook smaller portions of it fresh on the spot in the open kitchen that you can see while being seated you can basically eat as much as you want i was not sure what to try but my server nessa was a sweetheart and ask me a few questions about flavors and meats and i let her decide for me i just said hook me up had the lental cake tower naan bread stuffed with potatoes and peas shrimp curry chicken tikka masala and some type of carrot desert i could of eaten more but i was feeling pretty full great flavors and aromas you can get mild or as spicy as you want food was fresh healthy and presentation was great i cant wait to try more of the dishes i am an indian and i have eaten at this place couple of times and the food here is not indian food but a modernistic type of dishes which uses some indian spices to give it a very very mild indian food taste dont go there expecting to get your chicken tandoori or spicy chicken tikka fix as it aint gonna do it for you its funny when some of the reviewers are referring it as indian food its like comparing taco bell food with mexican food one of our visits couple of years ago was during their happy hour which i thought was a good conceptif you want real north or south indian food there are plenty of good places in the valley,3.1666666666666665,18

OM Restaurant,as an indian i am rather fussy about food from my country and while i will often put up with mediocre offerings i am very pleased to report that the food here is very authentic and deliciousethnic food seems to finally be making some firm inroads in the henderson eastern corridor  om is the latest addition just south of serene - you have to look for it since it is set back a bit from the street  it is a relatively small restaurant with a definite take-out setup and vibe  the food is all laid out on a steam table and the menu choices are clearly displayed on big light boards behind the counter  the food is on display with matching photographs on the menu boardsthe basic premise is very similar to panda express - a side plus 2 entrees $699 with 3 entrees $899  sides offered are naan white rice pulao rice and noodles  as with pe you can select a half and half combo of two different sidesthree of us ate there and between us we tried the chicken tikka masala lamb vindaloo and chili chicken which were all terrific  on the vegetarian side of the menu we tasted the palak paneer aloo gobi and the daal  i didnt have any of the veggies but my friends gave them all a strong thumbs upi expect to be back there frequently both to eat there and for take out oh my gosh! yuuum!we went here after work today and it was so delicious! all the food is prepped and if you want it spicier they will make it to order for you! garlic naan is so good they literally make the dough when you order it and cook it in an industrial tandoor right there for you to seethe food is delicious the staff is super nice and friendly i ordered a 2 entree plate with chicken tikka masala as both entrees which they were more than happy to do and basmati rice for $699 this was an amazing deal!my girlfriend ordered lam vindaloo as both entrees and basmati rice you can choose rice or naan but you can also get an extra order of it on the side for $199 and its huge probably before being cut about the size of a small pizza plus its amazingly deliciousif you want quick delicious well priced indian cuisine this is the place for you! we will definitely be coming back here and i suggest you all go! my favorite in las vegas has been mint for last 4 years i have tried many of the other popular indian restaurants and none of them have come closer to mint until last month one of my friend recommended this location to me and said that food is cooked in front of you and the prices are reasonable i bookmarked this location on yelp and i finally went for it one dayits located on a plaza by 215 and eastern this area is always busy with many restaurants in the location so parking might be a small issue the restaurant is not lavish like many other indian restaurants they have tv where some indian music is played but over all its atmosphere is more like  robertos the owners are nepalese and the food is mainly north indian with some that have obvious nepalese fusion to it i always get two curries naan and basmati rice at this location so far i have tried chicken tikka masala palak panner (spinach w/ cottage cheese my fav) chilli chicken chicken karai and their garlic naan i think this restaurant has the most authentic indian flavor of any restaurant and the food is cooked fresh in front of you this prices are also very low compared to taj and mint and its an excellent place for take out meals when i first went to this restaurant they were running a promotion of 20% off the entire bill for only month of march this made the deals even more special i also saw that they do deliveries now i highly recommend that you stop by to try out their sampler plates (thali) which come with 1-2 entrees and 1-3 side dishes they also have groupon and amazon/living social dealsoverall (5/5) delicious food and great prices!i got the thali-1 plate which includes 2 entrees and a side for $699 i chose the chili chicken and lamb vindaloo for my entrees and the naan for my side i like spicy food and these entrees are both considered medium hot which is why i picked them the dishes did have a little kick to them (more so the chili chicken) but i would have preferred a little more heat but looking past that the flavors were spot on! the sauce for the lamb was extremely flavorful and great for soaking up with the naan i also got a little taste from my friends plates of the chicken tikka masala and chicken karahi and id order them both in the future like i said my only gripe is the spiciness since there arent many dishes that are spicy here i wish you could choose the spiciness level like many other indian restaurants offer oh well! as for the atmosphere of this place it is very casual just booths and mostly blank walls with the occasional random wall hanging they clearly dont care about the decor but i dont either as long as they continue to serve quality food! went in today ordered the chicken tikka and the puloa rice the chicken tikka was tasty but a little to dry for my taste the rice was pretty good  the next time i go in i will order the lamb and some of the items on the pre made menu otherwise cant complain food is cheap place is clean! i am giving this place a very generous 4 star as i was thinking it was about a 35 star  it is nearly a 4overall i really enjoy indian food and have had it in so many places around the world including delhi and bangalore  here is what i like:a fast - during lunch most of the food in their special lunch menu is already prepared and kept warm so getting your food is very fastb  selection - very simple and clear cut all types of curry and spice levels that you would wantc  the ambiance - very utilitarian in decor design and feeling i dont mind it but it is on the very inexpensive mode unlike other restaurantsd  the food - the most important aspect i love lamb so we ordered the lamb vindaloo  this is my second time ordering this dish  the first order time we came here the lamb vindaloo was very mild  this second time i asked for it to be hotter and they said it naturally was going to be anyway   i do admit the spice was just right and the lamb was very tasty  the chicken tikka masala was okay not too inspiring  we also had the alloo goobi and this was good so three dishes between us two  the naan bread is darn good  the food is generally pretty decent!e  service - top notch and will help you to order what you want excellent service!f  why not 5 star? i am not sure  is it the paper plates?  is it the fast foodiness style of the restaurant?  is it the utilitarian feel or the fact that when i am there it is generally empty? not sure  the food here is good the lamb i feel is awesome and i will be coming back for suregk says check it out!  oh yeah  the prices are fantastic for the lunch menu! first timers here and we were not disappointed since we wanted to try different things on the menu we decided to try thali 1 (choice of 2 entrees and a side) for $699  for my entrees i got hot mango chicken chili chicken and naan for my side my daughter got chicken tikka malasa veggie korma and naan food was fresh & delicious  portion size was just right and we were able to eat everything we also got mango lassis they were so yummy & refreshing! establishment is clean and service was great  we will definitely be back =) we were grabbing cigars next door and decided to nosh where it was quick and convenient they do thali plates until 4pm so we both decided to go with a 2 entree 1 side combo lamb vindaloo had decent flavor but it definitely needed more time stewing as some of the meat pieces were soft but most were still chewy and needed time to break down unfortunately we both selected this and wish we differentiated a bit morechicken tikka masala was decent in flavor but it fell in the middle as far as tikkas ive had in the city go it was all breast pieces which for some people is a big plus paneer saag had a slightly pronounced tamarind like flavor but i was digging the creamy texture of this and they were generous on the paneer pieces we picked rice as our side and ordered a side dish of garlic naan (1 large piece cut in 4) which was crispy and well made if you want some fast indian food this is probably a good choice im not from this part of town so i dont think it would be something i would drive across town for i think for the price point of the two thali and drinks i rather go to a indian lunch buffet for more selection,4.375,8
Haveli Restaurant,we went for the lunch buffet i am thrilled to have indian cuisine close to work and a reasonably priced buffet  since we paid in cash it was $17 for 2 people for buffet with water as drinks  i thought the chicken tikka masala was ok everything else was wonderful i am looking forward to coming here again with my family for dinner the food quality is good prove is reasonable and the location and building is very nice the staff was friendly and helpful! no wait for a quick business lunch if youre riding on the bike path this is a great lunch stop for the price  all you can eat and mango ive cream for dessert!,5.0,1
Zest of India,do not go here!  it used to be taste of india or something like that  i went out of my way on a weekly basis to go there  until just last weekend  ugh  the pakoori were plain old fried veggies  the chicken tikka masala had chunks ofsomething white  the chicken itself seemed ok (how can you screw up tandoori???) but i will never ever go there agin!ne corner 32nd st and greenway*sigh*,1.0,1
Tanjore,as a curry lover it is always nice to find somewhere which has a slightly unique spin on (probably) one of this nations favourite things tanjore is a real south indian restaurant no standard chicken tikka masala or vindaloo here instead what is served is a selection of rich curries (i think most contain yoghurt or coconut milk) cooked well with an emphasis on vegetarian options and fishok that is the good the bad is that the service is just uneven never unpleasant but perhaps not that interested or simply not aware of where people are in their meals others have noted this too so i dont feel i need to push the issue however it is a shameall in all tanjore offers good and different curry and it is byob establishment so i will be back they just need to sort the service out a little,4.0,1
